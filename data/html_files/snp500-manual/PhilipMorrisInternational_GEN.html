Cookies are short computer programs written in human-readable text. They are placed on your device when you visit a site and are used to identify your device for the purposes described here.
<br><br>
Cookies set by the owner of a site are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by other people are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable the third party to provide services to us, so we can provide features or functionality on or through the site (like analytics, advertising and videos). The parties that set these cookies can recognize your device both when it visits our site, and when it visits certain other sites.
<br><br>
These cookies fall into three categories. Those in the first category are necessary. Those in the remaining two categories are optional: you can decide whether you want to receive them from us, and you can use this tool to set your preferences. You can change your mind at any time by following the link to “cookie preferences” from any page of the site.</div><button>Allow All</button><section><h3> Manage Consent Preferences</h3><div data-optanongroupid="C0001"><h4>Operational Cookies</h4><div>Always Active</div><p>These are essential to deliver the site, or features of it that you select, in a convenient way. Examples: remember who you are, your preferences and your settings, so you don’t need to enter them each time you change page; display content on your device properly; fraud prevention (e.g. to make sure the same person doesn’t complete the same survey twice).
