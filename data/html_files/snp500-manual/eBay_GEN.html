Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/company/privacy-center/" target="_blank">eBay Privacy Center<span> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)</h3>

<p>We may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section <a href="#section5">5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a>) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU, 2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available <a href="#section3">on request</a>. We regularly reevaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law, e.g. from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the matter C-311/18.</p>

<h2>7. &nbsp;Storage duration and erasure</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href="#section5">5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<div aria-expanded="true">
<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br>
	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br>
	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br>
	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>

<h2>8. &nbsp;Rights as a data subject</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and <strong>object</strong> to our processing of your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests. You can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

<div>
<h3 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="true">Learn more about section 8</h3>

<div aria-expanded="true">
<p>Your rights in detail:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain <strong>access</strong> to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, where possible the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data’s source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to access may be limited by national law.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the <strong>rectification</strong> of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us the <strong>erasure</strong> of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us <strong>restriction of processing your personal data</strong> to the extent that
	<ul>
		<li>the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,</li>
		<li>the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,</li>
		<li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or</li>
		<li>you have objected to the processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller ("<strong>right to data portability</strong>").</li>
	<li>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a <strong>supervisory authority</strong>. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the <a href="#section2">controller</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your personal data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests, you have the <strong>right to object</strong> to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</p>

<h2>11. &nbsp;Other important information regarding data protection</h2>

<p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p>

<div>
<h3 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="true">Learn more about section 11</h3>

<div aria-expanded="true">
<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3>

<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</h3>

<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259" target="_blank">User Agreement</a> (including any of our <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205" target="_blank">rules and policies</a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</h3>

<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<h3>Staying Signed in</h3>

<p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bid, buy or make an offer on an item</li>
	<li>Check out or add items to your cart</li>
	<li>Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)</li>
	<li>View the activity header</li>
	<li>View the My eBay page</li>
	<li>View or edit the Watch List or order details</li>
	<li>View the profile page</li>
	<li>Send member-to-member messages</li>
	<li>Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims</li>
</ul>

<p>If you attempt to change your password or&nbsp;user ID, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.</p>

<p>You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.</p>

<h2>6. &nbsp;International data transfers</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.</p>

<h3>6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc. corporate family members</h3>

<p>The transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc. corporate family members (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc. corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations.

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)</h3>

<p>We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay.&nbsp;In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law.

<h2>7. &nbsp;Storage duration and erasure</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see <a href="#5">Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<div>
<h3 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Learn more about section 7</h3>

<div aria-expanded="false">
<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br>
	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Special categories of personal data</strong><br>
	If we store special categories of personal data (i.e., personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>
	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br>
	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br>
	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>

<h2>8. &nbsp;Rights as a data subject</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and <strong>object</strong> to our processing of your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests. You can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

<div>
<h3 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Learn more about section 8</h3>

<div aria-expanded="false">
<p>Your rights in detail:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain <strong>access</strong> to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data’s source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the <strong>rectification</strong> of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us the <strong>erasure</strong> of personal data concerning you, unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us <strong>restriction of processing</strong> to the extent that
	<ul>
		<li>the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,</li>
		<li>the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,</li>
		<li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or</li>
		<li>you have objected to the processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller ("<strong>right to data portability</strong>").</li>
	<li>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a <strong>supervisory authority</strong>. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the <a href="#2">controller</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your personal data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests, you have the <strong>right to object</strong> to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</p>

<p>The exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g. right to access or erasure) is generally free of charge. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs) in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations or refuse to process the application.</p>

<h2>10. &nbsp;Data security</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>We protect your personal data through technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure and alteration. To this end we use firewalls and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and authorization controls for data access. You can find further information on our data security in our <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/index.html" target="_blank">Security Center<span> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h2>11. &nbsp;Other important information regarding data protection</h2>

<p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p>

<div>
<h3 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Learn more about section 11</h3>

<div aria-expanded="false">
<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3>

<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</h3>

<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259" target="_blank">User Agreement</a> (including any of our <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205" target="_blank">rules and policies</a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</h3>

<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<h3>Staying Signed in</h3>

<p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bid, buy or make an offer on an item</li>
	<li>Check out or add items to your cart</li>
	<li>Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)</li>
	<li>View the activity header</li>
	<li>View the My eBay page</li>
	<li>View or edit the Watch List or order details</li>
	<li>View the profile page</li>
	<li>Send member-to-member messages</li>
	<li>Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims</li>
</ul>

<p>If you attempt to change your password or&nbsp;user ID, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.</p>

<p>You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.</p>
