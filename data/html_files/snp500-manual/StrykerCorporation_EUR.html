This includes obtaining written assurances from any third party given access to your data, so as to require them to adopt standards that ensure an equivalent level of protection for data as that adopted by Stryker and standardised corporate safeguards and contractual measures (based on the European Commission Model Clauses) for internal data transfers to Stryker affiliates in third countries that are deemed to provide an inadequate level of data protection.<br></p><p><span><span>Privacy Statement for Children</span></span><br>Stryker will not collect personal information from anyone we know to be under the age of 16 without the prior, verifiable consent from his or her legal representative.
