				</p><p><strong>ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services Principles</strong></p><p>
					The ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services is based on a set of data protection principles outlined below.
				</p><p><strong>Data Processing Purposes</strong></p><p>
					ADP shall Process Client Data on behalf of the Client, only in accordance with the Service Agreement, pursuant to any documented instructions received from the Client, or as needed to comply with Applicable Law.
				</p><p>
					ADP processes personal data (including Special Categories of Data) pertaining to client employees as needed to provide client services, client support activities, as required by EEA applicable law and for the following additional purposes:
				</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  a. Hosting, storage, and other processing needed for business continuity and disaster recovery;<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp;  b. System and network administration and security, including infrastructure monitoring, identity and credential management, verification and authentication, and access control;<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp;  c. Monitoring and other controls needed to safeguard the security and integrity of transactions;<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp;  d. Enforcing contracts and protecting ADP, its associates, clients, client employees, and the public against theft, legal liability, fraud, or abuse; and<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp;  e. Approved ADP internal business processes.</p><p>
					Upon termination of the Service Agreement, ADP shall fulfill its obligations to the client with regard to the returning the data and securely destroying the data, subject to EEA applicable law.
				</p><p><strong>Security Requirements</strong></p><p>
					ADP has implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures to protect Client Data from misuse or accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, acquisition, or access during the Processing, which will meet the requirements of EEA Applicable Law, or any stricter requirements, as imposed under the Service Agreement.
				</p><p>
					Access to Client Data will be authorized only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable Data Processing Purposes and requirements of the Service Agreements. ADP staff with access to client data will be subject to confidentiality obligations.
				</p><p>
					ADP shall notify the client of a data security breach without undue delay after becoming aware that such a breach has occurred, unless a law enforcement official or supervisory authority determines that notification would impede a criminal investigation, or cause damage to national security or a breach of trust in the relevant industry sector.
				</p><p><strong>Transparency to Client Employees</strong></p><p>
					ADP shall promptly notify the Client of requests or complaints related to the Processing of personal data by ADP that are received directly from client employees without responding to such requests or complaints, unless otherwise provided in the Service Agreement or instructed by the client.
				</p><p><strong>Subprocessors</strong></p><p>
					Third Party Subprocessors may only Process Client Data pursuant to a Subprocessor Contract. The Subprocessor Contract shall impose similar data protection-related Processing terms on the Third Party Subprocessor that will be not less protective than those imposed on the ADP Contracting Entity by the Service Agreement and the ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services.
				</p><p>
					ADP shall publish an overview of the categories of Subprocessors involved in the performance of the relevant Client Services and ADP shall provide notice to the Client of any new Subprocessors engaged by ADP for the delivery of the Client Services. Clients have 30 days from notification date to object to the use of new Subprocessors engaged by ADP.
				</p><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><p>
					ADP’s privacy program is managed by ADP’s Global Chief Privacy Officer and the members of the Data Privacy and Governance Team. ADP has implemented a Privacy Network comprised of the members of the Data Privacy and Governance Team and other members of the Legal department, including compliance professionals, and Data Protection Officers, who are in charge of privacy compliance within their respective regions, countries, Business Units or Functional areas.
				</p><p>
					Additionally, Privacy Stewards are Executives who have been appointed by ADP senior leaders to implement and enforce compliance with ADP’s privacy program within their respective Business Units or Functional areas. Privacy Stewards and selected members of the Privacy Network serve on ADP’s Privacy Leadership Council, led by ADP’s Global Chief Privacy Officer, to oversee privacy compliance at ADP.
				</p><p><strong>Compliance</strong></p><p>
					ADP shall respond promptly and appropriately to requests for assistance from the Client to enable the Client to comply with its obligations, subject to Applicable Law and in accordance with the Service Agreement.
				</p><p><strong>Monitoring and Audit</strong></p><p>
					ADP will address Client audit requests and will answer questions asked by the Client regarding the Processing of Client Data by ADP. If further information is requested, in agreement with Client, ADP will either a) allow an independent third party assessor to conduct an audit, no more than annually per client, subject to a 45 day written notice and bound by confidentiality terms, or b) provide the Client with a statement from a third party assessor, indicating ADP’s compliance with the ADP Privacy Code for Client Data Processing Services. Additionally, ADP will allow its Processing facilities to be audited by any DPA of an EEA Country which is competent to audit an ADP Client.
				</p><p>

				</p><p><strong>Implementation</strong></p><p>
					The effective date of the ADP Privacy Code for Business Data is April 11, 2018. ADP will implement the ADP Privacy Code for Business Data across the relevant ADP Group Companies within 18 months of the effective date.

					Special categories of data may be processed for any other legitimate purpose, if ADP obtains the prior explicit consent of the Individual.
				</p><p><strong>Quantity and Quality of Data</strong></p><p>
					ADP shall establish and implement retention schedules so that records containing Personal Data are only retained as needed to fulfill the applicable Business Purposes, to comply with applicable legal requirements, or as advisable in light of applicable statutes of limitations.
				</p><p>
					Personal Data should be accurate, complete, and kept up-to-date to the extent reasonably necessary for the applicable Business Purposes. It is the responsibility of Individuals to ensure that their Personal Data are accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
				</p><p><strong>Individual Rights of Access, Rectification and Objection</strong></p><p>
					Individuals have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data maintained by or on behalf of ADP. If the personal data are incorrect, incomplete, or not processed in compliance with applicable law or the ADP Privacy Code for Business Data, the Individual has the right to have the personal data rectified, restricted or erased (as appropriate).
				</p><p>
					Additionally, Individuals have the right to object to a) the Processing of their Personal Data on the basis of compelling grounds related to their particular situation, or b) receiving direct marketing communications (opting-out).
				</p><p>
					Information around the process for submitting an Individual Rights Request can be found in Article 7 of the ADP Privacy Code for Business Data.
				</p><p><strong>Security and Confidentiality Requirements</strong></p><p>
					ADP has implemented commercially reasonable and appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from misuse or accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, acquisition, or access.

					Access to Personal Data will be authorized only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable Business Purposes and ADP Staff with access to Personal Data will be subject to confidentiality obligations.
				</p><p>
					ADP shall investigate all known or suspected Data Security Breaches and shall document the facts relating thereto, its effects and the remedial actions taken. ADP shall notify Individuals of a Data Security Breach within a reasonable period of time following determination of such Data Security Breach if (a) the Individual is at a high risk of harm as a result of the Data Security Breach or, (b) (even if the Individual is not at a high risk of harm), if an applicable breach notification law requires Individual notification.
				</p><p><strong>Direct Marketing</strong></p><p>
					ADP respects the choices of Individuals and provides Individuals the choice to opt-in and opt-out of direct marketing. ADP will send direct marketing materials if the Individual has provided opt-in consent or if Applicable Law permits ADP to send marketing communications without explicit consent based on an existing business relationship.
				</p><p><strong>Transfer of Personal Data to Third Parties and Internal Processors</strong></p><p>
					ADP may transfer Personal Data to a Third Party and to Internal Processors to the extent necessary to serve the applicable Business Purposes.

				</p><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><p>
					ADP’s privacy program is managed by ADP’s Global Chief Privacy Officer and the members of the Data Privacy and Governance Team.

				</p><p>
					Additionally, Privacy Stewards are Executives who have been appointed by ADP senior leaders to implement and enforce compliance with ADP’s privacy program within their respective Business Units or Functional areas. Privacy Stewards and selected members of the Privacy Network serve on ADP’s Privacy Leadership Council, led by ADP’s Global Chief Privacy Officer, to oversee privacy compliance at ADP.
				</p><p><strong>Monitoring and Audit</strong></p><p>
