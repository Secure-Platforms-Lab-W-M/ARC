This is different than disabling cookies on your browser. Browsers with the "Do Not Track" functionality enabled continue to have the capability to accept cookies. There is currently no agreement or consensus on how companies should interpret a "Do Not Track" signal. Consequently, we do not honor "Do Not Track" signals. Instead, we allow you to exercise control over the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information about "Do Not Track," please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.<br><br>

 <strong>SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PRIVACY POLICY.</strong><br><br>
 D.R. Horton, as an employer, in the normal course of business and as required by law, collects social security numbers. In connection with accepting job applications, we will collect Personal Information from prospective new employees, including their social security number. This information is transmitted over a secure connection that implements encryption of the Personal Information being transmitted. In addition to secure connections and encryption for collection, we maintain other reasonable measures to protect and limit access to social security numbers on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we prohibit their unlawful disclosure. We maintain reasonable procedures to destroy, erase, or make unreadable any data, computer files and documents containing social security numbers prior to their disposal. Failure to follow these procedures by any employee may subject the employee to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.<br><br>

 D.R. Horton reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy, from time to time and as required by applicable law.

In such cases, we will provide prominent notice of such changes before they take effect. We encourage you to retain a copy of this Privacy Policy and periodically check this website for updates.&nbsp; <br><br>
 Your use of our Sites after changes have become effective indicates your acceptance of the latest version of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

 <strong>Your State Privacy Rights.</strong><br><br>
 Because D.R. Horton provides all of its customers, including its California customers, with a cost-free method to opt-out of the sharing of Personal Information with all third parties, including our Affiliates, for the direct marketing of those third parties, and does not disclose to third parties, including our Affiliates, for their direct marketing purposes the Personal Information of any customer if the customer has exercised the option to prevent such disclosure, and because D.R. Horton discloses these policies in this Privacy Policy, pursuant to California Civil Code section 1798.83(c)(2), D.R. Horton is in compliance with California's "Shine the Light" law.<br><br>
 California and Virginia residents may have further rights related to the handling of their Personal Information under applicable state law. D.R. Horton may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform services at your home and in our communities  and, in some cases, also to market products to you. In return, D.R.

Horton may share information about your browser or device with our Third-Party Service Providers, for the delivery of interest-based advertising to you. Such sharing may constitute a sale under applicable law. <br><br>
 D.R. Horton extends California and Virginia residents certain rights related to this information, including the rights to ask that we <a href="https://myprivacychoices.drhorton.com/?op=op1&amp;src=D1H0" target="_blank">Do Not Sell or Share Your Personal Information</a>, <a href="https://myprivacychoices.drhorton.com/?op=op3&amp;src=D1H0" target="_blank">Delete your Personal Information</a>, <a href="https://myprivacychoices.drhorton.com/?op=op4&amp;src=D1H0">Correct your Personal Information </a>, or the right to request <a href="https://myprivacychoices.drhorton.com/?op=op2&amp;src=D1H0" target="_blank">Access</a> to the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.

<p>We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability.</p>
<p>To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.</p>

<strong>Screen-reader and keyboard navigation</strong>
<p>Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screen-reader optimization:&nbsp;</strong>we run a process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images. It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.<br><br>These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Keyboard navigation optimization:&nbsp;</strong>The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.<br><br>Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside.<br><br>Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Assistive technology and browser compatibility</strong>
<p>We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users.</p>
<strong>Notes, comments, and feedback</strong>
<p>Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements. If you wish to contact the website’s owner, please use the website's form</p></div> </div> </div>
