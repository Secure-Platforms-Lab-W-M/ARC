This section addresses those rights and applies only to those individuals. </p> <h2>Roles</h2> <p> Data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors"). Domino's Pizza LLC acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and advertisements.

Any questions that you may have relating to the processing of personal data by Domino's Pizza as a processor should be directed to the relevant franchisee. </p> <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2> <p> Data protection laws in Europe require a "lawful basis" for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners, or franchisees; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Some of our lawful bases for processing your information stem from our independent franchisees on whose behalf we provide services. </p> <h2>Your European Privacy Rights</h2> <p> You have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us. </p> <p> To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled "Contact Us" above and specify which right you intend to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Further, if we are processing your information on behalf of one of our franchisees, we will refer you to that franchisee, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request. Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. </p> <p> If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority. </p> <h2>Data Transfer and Privacy Shield</h2> <p> Domino's Pizza uses standard contractual clauses to provide the required safeguards for the transfer and processing of personal data from Europe. </p> <p> In addition, despite its invalidation, Domino's Pizza maintains its participation in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S., respectively.

This means that, in addition to our other obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, we shall be liable to you for any third-party agent to which we transfer your personal data and that processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages. </p> <p> For inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with Privacy Shield, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled "Contact Us" below. If we are unable to resolve your complaint directly, you may submit your complaint at no cost to you to the JAMS at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>.
