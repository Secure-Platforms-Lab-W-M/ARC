<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc (subsequently: Google). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies," i.e. text files which are stored on your computer and which make it possible to analyze how you use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, due to the activation of IP anonymization on these websites, your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. For the exceptional cases in which personal data is transferred to the USA, Google has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.</a> On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide further services to the website operator in connection with website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.<br><br>In connection with Google Analytics, we use Google conversion tracking. This enables us to obtain more precise information about the behavioral patterns of our website visitors that we wish to obtain. For example, we can evaluate how often forms are sent and/or from which external sources and through which target paths visitors are led to our website (advertisements, social media, other internal pages, etc.).<br><br>The purposes of the data processing are to evaluate the use of the website and to compile reports on activities on the website. Based on the use of the website and the Internet, further related services may then be provided. The processing is based on the legitimate interest of the website operator in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.<br><br>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank">Browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics.</a><br><br>In addition or as an alternative to the browser add-on, you can prevent tracking by Google Analytics on our pages by clicking this link. An opt-out cookie will then be installed on your device. This will prevent Google Analytics from recording data for this website and for this browser in the future as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.<br><br>Further information on terms of use and data protection can be found at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/<br><br>We also use Google Analytics to evaluate data from AdWords and the DoubleClick cookie for statistical purposes. If you do not want this to occur, it can be disabled via the Ads Preferences Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous?hl=de).<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Google Tag Manager</strong></p>
<p>This website uses the Google Tag Manager. The Tag Manager does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, this remains in effect for all tracking tags that are implemented with Google Tag Manager. You can find Google's data protection information on this tool here: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/<br><br></p>
<h4>Google Ads conversion tracking and remarketing</h4>
<p>Our website uses Google conversion tracking. If you have reached our website via an advertisement placed by Google, Google Adwords will install a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an ad placed by Google. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie has not expired, we and Google will be able to recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information from Google that could identify you personally as a user.<br><br>If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can refuse the setting of a cookie that is required for this purpose - for example, by changing your browser settings to generally disable the automatic setting of cookies or to set your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleleadservices.com."<br><br>Please note that you may not delete the opt-out cookies as long as you do not wish measurement data to be recorded. If you have deleted all your cookies in your browser, you will have to set the respective opt-out cookie again.<br><br>This website uses the remarketing function of Google Inc. This function is used to present interest-based ads to website visitors within the Google advertising network. In the browser of the website visitor, a so-called "cookie" is stored on your computer which makes it possible to recognize the visitor when he or she visits websites belonging to the Google advertising network. On these pages, the visitor may be presented with advertisements relating to content that the visitor has previously viewed on websites that use Google's remarketing feature.<br><br>According to its own information, Google does not collect any personal data during this process. We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned measures. If you still do not wish to use Google's remarketing function, you can deactivate it by selecting the appropriate settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the ad network initiative by following the instructions at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Use of Hotjar</h4>
<p>This website uses Hotjar, a web analysis tool of Hotjar Ltd. based in Malta. It records interactions of randomly selected, individual visitors with the website in an anonymous form. In this way, a log of e.g. mouse movements and clicks is created with the aim of showing improvement possibilities for the respective website.<br><br>Hotjar uses "cookies," text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. In order to exclude the possibility of direct personal references, IP addresses are only stored and processed anonymously. In addition, information on the operating system, browser, incoming and outgoing references (links), geographical origin, as well as resolution and type of device are evaluated for statistical purposes. This information is not personal and will not be passed on to third parties by us or by Hotjar. The data is stored in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud on servers in Ireland. <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy" target="_blank">Click here for more information about data storage by Hotjar</a><br><br>If you do not wish your activity to be recorded, you can deactivate the recording on all Internet sites that use Hotjar by setting the DoNotTrack header in your browser.

<h4>Visable tracking pixel</h4>
<p>For analysis and marketing purposes, the website uses products and services that are provided in cooperation with Visable GmbH (www.visable.com). For this purpose, tracking pixels technology is used to collect and process data to create at least pseudonymized, and where possible and meaningful, completely anonymous user profiles. The processing takes place for the purpose of collecting company-relevant information such as the company name. The data collected, which may initially contain personal data, is transmitted to Visable or collected directly by Visable and used there to create the usage profiles. Personal identification of visitors to this website does not take place, and no other personal data is merged with the usage profiles. If IP addresses are identified as personal, they will be deleted immediately.
This analysis tool is used based on your consent. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.</p>

<h4>Use of script libraries (Google Fonts)</h4>
<p>In order to display our content correctly and in a graphically appealing manner across all browsers, we use script libraries and font libraries on this website such as <a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/" target="_blank">Fonts</a>. Google Fonts are transferred to your browser's cache to avoid repeated loading. If the browser does not support Google Fonts or prevents access, content will be displayed in a default font.<br><br>The retrieval of script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the operator of the library. It is theoretically possible - although it is currently unclear whether and for what purposes - that operators of such libraries collect data.<br><br>The privacy policy of the library operator Google can be found here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Use of Google Maps</h4>
<p>This website uses the Google Maps API to visually display geographic information. When using Google Maps, Google also collects, processes and uses data (including the IP address) about the use of the map functions by visitors. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account you are logged in to or whether no user account exists. Google also processes your data in the USA and has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.</a><br><br>[The processing is based on the legitimate interest of the website operator in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

<h4>Social plug-ins</h4>
<p>On our websites and within the signatures or our emails, we use social plug-ins from the providers listed below. You can recognize the plug-ins by the fact that they are indicated with the corresponding logo.<br><br>These plug-ins may be used to send information, which could include personal data, to the service provider and may be used by the latter. We prevent the unknowing and unwanted collection and transmission of data to the service provider by means of a 2-click solution. In order to activate a particular social plug-in, it must first be activated by clicking on the corresponding button. The collection of information and its transmission to the service provider is only triggered when the plug-in is activated.</p>
<p>By activating the plug-in, your personal data is transferred to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers in the USA). We do not ourselves collect any personal data by means of the social plug-ins or through their use. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users. In this manner, we would like to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The processing is based on the legitimate interest of the website operator in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.<br><br>We have no influence on the data an activated plug-in collects and how this data is used by the provider. At present, it is to be assumed that a direct connection to the provider's services is established and at least the IP address and device-related information is collected and used. It is also possible that the service providers try to store cookies on the computer being used. To find out which specific data is collected and how it is used, please refer to the data protection information of the respective service provider.</p>
<p>The data is transmitted regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in with this provider. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, the data we collect from you will be immediately linked to your existing account with the plug-in provider.<br><br>We have integrated the social media buttons of the following companies on our website and within the signatures or our emails:<br><br></p>

We use two types of cookies on our websites: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are always deleted when the browser is closed.<br><br>Persistent cookies remain stored in your browser and can be used again during your next visit. Cookies that are set by our websites are deleted at the latest two years after your last visit to one of our websites, unless you delete them first.<br><br>You can effectively prevent all records of your sessions on our websites if you deactivate the setting of cookies via the settings of your Internet browser, or authorize the setting of cookies only for specific purposes. These settings can be made very selectively, so that the functionality of the visited website can be maintained, while unwanted further tracking is prevented.<br><br>Your browser's documentation provides instructions for how to do this. This documentation is easily found by means of a search-engine search with the keywords "block cookies [your Internet browser]" (replace [your Internet browser] with the name of your browser, e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.).<br><br>Further information on the services used on our website and the options for deactivating cookies can be found in the relevant section.</p>
<h4>Information on hosting and the employed content management system</h4>
<p>In order to protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods via HTTPS.<br><br>The storage of IP addresses in the logs of our content management system and in the logs of our hosting provider (Mittwald) has been switched off or is done anonymously.<br><br></p>
<h4>Information about tracking on the Internet pages of paychex.de</h4>
<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc (subsequently: Google). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies," i.e. text files which are stored on your computer and which make it possible to analyze how you use the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, due to the activation of IP anonymization on these websites, your IP address will be truncated by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states which are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide further services to the website operator in connection with website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.<br><br>In connection with Google Analytics, we use Google conversion tracking. This enables us to obtain more precise information about the behavioral patterns of our website visitors that we wish to obtain. For example, we can evaluate how often forms are sent and/or from which external sources and through which target paths visitors are led to our website (advertisements, social media, other internal pages, etc.).<br><br>The purposes of the data processing are to evaluate the use of the website and to compile reports on activities on the website. Based on the use of the website and the Internet, further related services may then be provided. The legal basis for the processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 lit. a GDPR (consent).<br><br>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics.</a><br><br>In addition or as an alternative to the browser add-on, you can prevent tracking by Google Analytics on our pages by clicking this link. An opt-out cookie will then be installed on your device. This will prevent Google Analytics from recording data for this website and for this browser in the future as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.<br><br>Further information on terms of use and data protection can be found at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html or https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/<br><br>We also use Google Analytics to evaluate data from AdWords and the DoubleClick cookie for statistical purposes. If you do not want this to occur, it can be disabled via the Ads Preferences Manager (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous?hl=de).<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Google Tag Manager</strong></p>
<p>This website uses the Google Tag Manager. The Tag Manager does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, this remains in effect for all tracking tags that are implemented with Google Tag Manager. You can find Google's data protection information on this tool here: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/<br><br></p>
<h4>Google Ads conversion tracking and remarketing</h4>
<p>Our website uses Google conversion tracking. If you have reached our website via an advertisement placed by Google, Google Adwords will install a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an ad placed by Google. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie has not expired, we and Google will be able to recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to that page. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information from Google that could identify you personally as a user.<br><br>If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can refuse the setting of a cookie that is required for this purpose - for example, by changing your browser settings to generally disable the automatic setting of cookies or to set your browser to block cookies from the domain "googleleadservices.com."<br><br>Please note that you may not delete the opt-out cookies as long as you do not wish measurement data to be recorded. If you have deleted all your cookies in your browser, you will have to set the respective opt-out cookie again.<br><br>This website uses the remarketing function of Google Inc. This function is used to present interest-based ads to website visitors within the Google advertising network. In the browser of the website visitor, a so-called "cookie" is stored on your computer which makes it possible to recognize the visitor when he or she visits websites belonging to the Google advertising network. On these pages, the visitor may be presented with advertisements relating to content that the visitor has previously viewed on websites that use Google's remarketing feature.<br><br>According to its own information, Google does not collect any personal data during this process. We ourselves do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned measures. If you still do not wish to use Google's remarketing function, you can deactivate it by selecting the appropriate settings at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the ad network initiative by following the instructions at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>
<p>Further information about data processing by Google can be found in the Google privacy policy. There, you can also change your personal data privacy settings in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Centre.</a></p>

<h3>Visable tracking pixel</h3>
<p>For analysis and marketing purposes, the website uses products and services that are provided in cooperation with Visable GmbH (www.visable.com). For this purpose, tracking pixels technology is used to collect and process data to create at least pseudonymized, and where possible and meaningful, completely anonymous user profiles. The processing takes place for the purpose of collecting company-relevant information such as the company name. The data collected, which may initially contain personal data, is transmitted to Visable or collected directly by Visable and used there to create the usage profiles. Personal identification of visitors to this website does not take place, and no other personal data is merged with the usage profiles. If IP addresses are identified as personal, they will be deleted immediately.<br>This analysis tool is used based on your consent. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The consent can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.</p>

<h4>Social plug-ins</h4>
<p>On our websites and within the signatures or our emails, we use social plug-ins from the providers listed below. You can recognize the plug-ins by the fact that they are indicated with the corresponding logo.<br><br>These plug-ins may be used to send information, which could include personal data, to the service provider and may be used by the latter. We prevent the unknowing and unwanted collection and transmission of data to the service provider by means of a 2-click solution. In order to activate a particular social plug-in, it must first be activated by clicking on the corresponding button. The collection of information and its transmission to the service provider is only triggered when the plug-in is activated.</p>
<p>By activating the plug-in, your personal data is transferred to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers in the USA). We do not ourselves collect any personal data by means of the social plug-ins or through their use. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users. In this manner, we would like to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The processing is based on the legitimate interest of the website operator in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.<br><br>We have no influence on the data an activated plug-in collects and how this data is used by the provider. At present, it is to be assumed that a direct connection to the provider's services is established and at least the IP address and device-related information is collected and used. It is also possible that the service providers try to store cookies on the computer being used. To find out which specific data is collected and how it is used, please refer to the data protection information of the respective service provider.</p>
<p>The data is transmitted regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in with this provider. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, the data we collect from you will be immediately linked to your existing account with the plug-in provider.<br><br>We have integrated the social media buttons of the following companies on our website and within the signatures of our emails:</p>

Appropriate safeguards: Salesforce has submitted to the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors in third countries under the Standard Contractual Clauses pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
