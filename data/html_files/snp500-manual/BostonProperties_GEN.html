<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies.&nbsp; To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.&nbsp; Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.&nbsp; Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Services may not work properly.&nbsp; For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p>Our vendor, Presence Aware, uses the MAC addresses we collect at our Prudential Center retail location to provide us a number of performance metrics such as average linger time in store, number of visitors in store, conversion of passing trade to customers, number of return customers and average time between visits.&nbsp; Such MAC addresses are hashed and salted before being stored within Presence Aware’s servers.</p>
<p>Presence Aware should treat such information in accordance with its privacy policy. We encourage you to review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.presenceorb.com/instore-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presence Aware privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not wish for us to collect your device’s MAC address, Internet Protocol address or OS device name, turn off your device’s Wi-Fi.&nbsp; If you would like to exclude your Wi-Fi enabled device from location tracking, you may do so through a simple opt-out form, available&nbsp;<a href="https://smart-places.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing not to share your personal information.</strong>&nbsp;If you do not provide information that we need to provide the Services, we may not be able to provide you with the Services or certain features.&nbsp; We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Services when we request it.</p>

<h2>Other sites and services</h2>
<p>The Services may contain links to websites and other online services operated by third parties.&nbsp; These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.&nbsp; In addition, our content may be included on web pages or other online services that are not associated with us. We do not control websites or other online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions.&nbsp; Other websites and online services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.&nbsp; We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and online services you use.</p>
<h2>Security practices</h2>

<h2>International data transfers</h2>
