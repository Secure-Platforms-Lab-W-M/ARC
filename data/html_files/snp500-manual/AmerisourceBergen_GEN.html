<p><em>Information We Receive From Other Sources</em><br>
We work closely with certain third parties (including, for example, our affiliates, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, public websites, public agencies, market research companies, and other contractors or consultants) and may receive information about you from them.

<p><em>Legal Basis Under EU General Data Protection Regulation for Processing Personal Data of EU Residents<br>
</em>Where you have consented to data processing, your consent provides the legal basis to process your Personal Data (as defined above). You have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Please note that your withdrawal of consent to collect and process your Personal Data will not affect the lawfulness of processing your Personal Data based on your consent before you withdrew your consent. We may also process your Personal Data on the basis of contractual necessity to perform a contract we have with you. We may also process your Personal Data on the basis of our legitimate interests, including in providing and improving our services. For example, AmerisourceBergen has a legitimate interest in understanding your login history so we can assess your interaction with our services. We also have a legitimate interest in providing and developing interesting features to provide to our users. Where we rely on legitimate interests to process your Personal Data, you have the right to object to such processing (meaning that you can ask us to stop). You can use your privacy settings to control certain ways in which we process your Personal Data. You can also contact us, using the details below, to object to other forms of processing.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing Your Information<br>
</strong></p>

<p><em>Our Use of Certain Third-Party Services</em></p>
<p><em></em><span>Third-Party Advertising<br>
</span>We may use third parties, including ad networks, to display advertising on the Web Site.
