<em>Third-Party Online Analytics Services</em><br>
<br>
Through our Digital Services, we may obtain personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party apps, websites, devices and other online services. We use third-party online analytics services on our Digital Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services use automated technologies to collect data (such as email, IP addresses, cookies and other device identifiers) to evaluate, for example, use of our Digital Services and to diagnose technical issues.

<br>
<em>Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising</em><br>
<br>
Through our Digital Services, both we and certain third parties may collect information about your online activities to provide you with advertising about products, services and corporate initiatives tailored to your individual interests. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent for the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes. You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users' inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track users' online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, server logs and other similar technologies. The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals' interests, to track users' browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users' online browsing and app usage activities. The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users' visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our Digital Services and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.<br>
