We may also screen you for symptoms of potential contagions, such as COVID-19, that may present a risk to the other guests and crew members aboard our ships, including through temperature checks, self-assessment questionnaires and tissue sampling.

We operate closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras on board our ships, including at all access points and throughout the public areas. These CCTV cameras record continually and <strong><em>images of you</em></strong> may appear in these recordings ("<strong>CCTV images</strong>"). Photographers and camera crews take photographs and make films for guests to purchase at the end of their vacation or for our own promotional use. They are happy to take reasonable steps to avoid filming or photographing you where you indicate to the person with the camera that this is your preference , but we are unable to guarantee that your images will not be included on an incidental basis.

We may apply facial recognition technology to your security photo to facilitate camera-enabled rapid embarkation, debarkation, at entry and exit of the vessel at ports of call. We may also use facial recognition to link the pictures and videos taken by onboard photographers or videographers to you for ease of ordering and to reduce paper waste. After sailing, you will still be able to access your linked photos and videos via our connection with a third-party photo library service.

<p align="center"><strong>COVID-19 NOTICE</strong></p>

<p>In response to the global coronavirus pandemic and to protect against the risks of other communicable illness, all guests may be required to undergo health screenings and we will collect additional information recommended by public health authorities or other government agencies or to otherwise demonstrate our guests’ ongoing health and fitness to travel, including:</p>

<ul type="disc"><li><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong> . Information such as name, nationality, country of residence, originating address, destination address, telephone, and email;</li>
	<li><strong>SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH INFORMATION</strong> .<strong> </strong>Information regarding the presence or absence of possible COVID-19 or other global pandemic symptoms, which may be collected through temperature scans, tissue sampling, medical examinations, surveys or questionnaires, as well as information about pre-existing medical conditions;</li>
	<li><strong>EXPOSURE</strong> . <strong> </strong>Information regarding potential exposure to or infection with COVID-19 or other global pandemic, which may include recent travel history, contacts with guests, crew or other individuals. ;</li>
	<li><strong>CONTACT TRACING VIA WEARABLE DEVICE TECHNOLOGY AND OCEANORBIT™ CONTACT TRACING SYSTEM. </strong> Information about on-board contacts with crew, guests or other individuals collected via wearable technology such as the Medallion® on MedallionClass™ ships and properties and/or the OceanOrbit™ Contract Tracing system. These devices collect data, such as personal contact, time stamp, duration of contact and frequency of contact with others.</li>
	<li><strong>AS REQUIRED BY LAW</strong> .<strong> </strong>Information collected by our on-board crew or reservations staff pursuant to directives by public health organizations or other government agencies.</li>
</ul><p>We collect and use this information because:</p>

<ul type="disc"><li>we must comply with certain regulatory requirements regarding public health, including to determine your fitness to travel consistent with applicable government regulations and guidelines;</li>
	<li>we have a legitimate business interest in ensuring the health and safety of our passengers, crew and the public;</li>
	<li>we have a legitimate business interest in complying with legal and regulatory requirements applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate;</li>
	<li>we need to use this information to perform our contract with you to provide our vacation experiences.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Contact Tracing through OceanOrbit</strong> ™<strong> Contract Tracing System. </strong>To help mitigate and manage the potential spread of COVID-19 or other global pandemic illnesses, we use wearable device technology to identify individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and to rapidly detect potential secondary cases that may arise after transmission from an infected individual. The OceanOrbit™ device is a wearable portable electronic device that collects data as guests and crew interact with one another in public and in private areas by broadcasting and recording the presence and proximity of other OceanOrbit™ devices. The OceanOrbit™ system collects time stamps, duration of contact and frequency of contacts. The raw data is associated with the device ID number but will be correlated with guest or crew personal information in the event that contract tracing is called for. On MedallionClass ships, we may use on board contact data collected in connection with the Medallion, rather than the OceanOrbit™ system, which will be linked to your personal information in the same manner as all other OCEAN® data. As part of our contract tracing efforts, we take reasonable precautions to respect our Guests’ privacy and confidentiality by communicating contact exposure information in a manner that is not personally identifiable. However, information about you may be disclosed in a manner that could allow the recipient to determine your identity. For example, if we determine that it is necessary to disclose to a guest that she was in contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 for a period of 1-2 hours on a particular date, that guest may be able to ascertain the likely identity of the unnamed individual based on her personal experience.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information, contacts and health information with third parties or individuals to attend to your medical and safety needs and those of our guests and crew; to comply with legal and regulatory requirements; to facilitate public health response initiaves; to conduct contract tracing of individuals who are exposed to or test positive for COVID-19 or other communicable illness while staying with us; or if we reasonably believe that such disclosure is necessary to inform your health care or to protect the personal safety or health of our guests, crew, or other individuals. For example, we may disclose personal identifiers and health or medical information to our personnel and contractors, port agents and authorities, government officials, health agencies or any other individual or institution as reasonably needed to support public health initiatives, comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, attend to your medical and safety needs, facilitate investigations and remedies, track and mitigate risks of communicable illness including COVID-19, and to protect the rights, health and safety of our guests, crew, and others.</p>

</ul><p><strong>Data Retention. </strong> We will only store your personal information for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes of collection as set out in this Privacy Notice in accordance with our data retention policies, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law. If we are required by applicable law to store your personal information beyond this period (e.g., for tax and commercial law reasons), we will delete the personal information after the end of this storage period.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use and disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process the personal information, and the applicable legal requirements. After the expiry of the aforementioned retention periods, we will delete or anonymize your personal information.</p>
