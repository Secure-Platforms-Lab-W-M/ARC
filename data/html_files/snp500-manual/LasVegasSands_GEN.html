    <div><h2>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h2></div>	<div>
		<p>We use cookies, web beacons (including pixels and tags) and similar technologies on our Online Channels that collect certain information about you by automated means.</p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.</p>
<p>We use these automated technologies to collect information about your devices, browsing actions and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner includes IP address, device ID and other identifiers associated with your device, device type, device characteristics (such as operating system), the pages you visited on our websites, how you arrived at our websites, browser preferences and characteristics, clickstream data and other information about your online activities. We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).</p>
<p>The cookies we use on our Online Channels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strictly necessary cookies (which are necessary for us to provide you with our Online Channels);</li>
<li>With respect to analytics cookies, we use third-party analytics services on our Online Channels, such as those of Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics, visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Online Channels. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.</p>
<p>The third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Online Channels (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn) also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy notices of these providers.</p>
<p>Certain web browsers allow you to instruct your browser to send Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to websites you visit, informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be tracked. Our Online Channels currently are not designed to respond to DNT signals received from web browsers.</p>
