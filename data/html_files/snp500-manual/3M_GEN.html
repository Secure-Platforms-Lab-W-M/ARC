<p dir="ltr"><strong>3M’s lawful basis for processing your personal data</strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>The lawful basis for 3M’s processing of your personal data will depend on the purposes of the processing. For most personal data processing activities covered by this Privacy Policy, the lawful basis is that the processing is necessary for 3M’s legitimate business interests. Where we process personal data in relation to a contract, or a potential contract, with you, the lawful basis is that the processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. When we are required to share personal data with law enforcement agencies or other governmental bodies, we do so on the basis that we are under a legal obligation to do so. We will also use consent as the legal basis where we deem appropriate or to the extent required by applicable law, for example, before we collect precise location data from your mobile device.</li>
	<li>More Information
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Processing on the basis of legitimate business interests.</strong> When we process personal information on the basis that the processing is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such interests include: &nbsp;providing, improving, and promoting 3M Internet Sites, Apps, products, and services; (ii) communicating with current and potential customers, other Business Partners, suppliers, vendors and their respective individual points of contact; (iii) managing our relationships with our customers, vendors, and other Business Partners, and their individual points of contact; (iv) other business development purposes; (v) sharing information within the 3M group, as well as with service providers and other third parties; and (vi) maintaining the safety and security of our products, services and employees, including fraud protection.</li>
		<li><strong>Processing on the basis of performance of a contract. </strong>Examples of situations in which we process personal information as necessary for performance of a contract include e-commerce transactions in which you purchase a product or service from 3M, on your own behalf, through a 3M Internet Site or App.</li>
		<li><strong>Processing on the basis of consent. </strong>Examples of processing activities for which 3M uses consent as its legal basis include: &nbsp;collecting and processing precise location information from your mobile device; (ii) sending promotional emails when consent is required under applicable law; and (iii) processing personal data on 3M Internet Sites or Apps through cookies and similar technologies when consent is required by applicable law.</li>
		<li><strong>Processing because 3M is under a legal obligation to do so. </strong>Examples of situations in which 3M must processes personal data to comply with its legal obligations include: &nbsp;payment of taxes and other government levies; (ii) providing your personal data to law enforcement agencies and other governmental bodies when required by applicable laws; (iii) retaining business records required to be retained by applicable laws; and (iv) complying with court orders or other legal process.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Additional information about the retention of your personal data</strong></p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>To determine the period for which your personal data will be retained in accordance with this Policy, 3M considers criteria such as: &nbsp;any applicable legal requirements to retain data for a certain period of time; (ii) any retention obligations related to actual or potential litigation or government investigations; (iii) any retention requirements in relevant agreements with our Business Partners; (iv) the date of your last interaction with 3M (including with 3M Internet Sites, Apps, communications, etc.); (v) the length of time between your interactions with 3M; (vi) the sensitivity of the data; and (vii) the purposes for which the data was collected.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Your individual rights</strong></p>

	<li>In accordance with the applicable laws in the European Union, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data, which apply differently in different circumstances: right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure, right to restriction of processing, right to data portability and right to object to processing. Most of these rights are not absolute. Below we describe these rights in more detail and provide information on how you can exercise them.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sensitive Personal Information.</strong> Notwithstanding the purposes described above, we do not use or disclose of sensitive personal information beyond the purposes authorized by applicable law (including the CCPA). &nbsp;Accordingly, we only use and disclose sensitive personal information as reasonably necessary (i) to perform our services requested by you, (ii) to help ensure security and integrity, including to prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents, (iii) to detect, prevent and respond to malicious, fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal conduct, (iv) to verify or maintain the quality and safety of our services, (v) for compliance with our legal obligations, (vi) to our service providers who perform services on our behalf, and (vii) for purposes other than inferring characteristics about you. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Retention.</strong> &nbsp;We retain the personal information we collect as reasonably necessary for the purposes described above or otherwise disclosed to you at the time of collection. &nbsp;For example, we will retain your transactional data for as long as necessary to comply with our tax, accounting and recordkeeping obligations, administer applicable returns and warranty programs, and for research, development and safety purposes, as well as an additional period of time as necessary to protect, defend or establish our rights, defend against potential claims, comply with legal obligations.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do Not Track Browser Settings.</strong> Some browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signals to the websites you visit. Because there is not common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, 3M currently does not take action in response to them.<br>

	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Exercising your Privacy Rights.</strong> &nbsp;You can exercise your U.S. privacy rights online or via telephone. &nbsp;For information on how to opt out of any cookie and pixel related “sales” and “sharing” or targeted advertising on any of our Internet Sites, please see the subsection “GPC and Cookie Opt-out” below.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Privacy Rights.</strong> Subject to certain limitations and exceptions under applicable law, verified residents in certain U.S. states (including California) may have, pursuant to applicable law, additional privacy rights with respect to their personal information with 3M. &nbsp;You may exercise the following U.S. privacy rights by completing this <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/050ed0e7-c955-4262-942e-02b7aff43a71" target="_blank">request form</a> or by contacting us toll free at 1-833-256-1792:&nbsp;</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to ask 3M to disclose to you (i) the categories of personal information, (ii) the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected, (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information, (iv) the categories of third parties to whom we disclose personal information, and (v) a copy of the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (see below).&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Access.</strong> You have a right to ask 3M to provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we retain about you, where feasible in a readily usable electronic format. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Correct.</strong> Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you, taking into account the nature and purposes of the processing of the personal information.</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Deletion.</strong> You have the right to ask 3M to delete personal information it has collected about you. &nbsp;The Right to Deletion may, subject to applicable law, not apply in certain circumstances, for example when 3M needs the personal information: (i) to complete a transaction with you, provide a good or service requested by you, or otherwise perform a contract with you; (ii) to detect or prevent security incidents or illegal activity; (iii) to identify and correct errors that impair existing functionality; (iv) for the exercise of a legal right or to ensure another person can exercise his or her legal right; (v) to comply with applicable legal requirements; (vi) to engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest if deletion of the personal information is likely to make the research impossible or seriously impair it; (vii) solely for internal uses that are reasonably aligned with expectations based on your relationship with 3M; (viii) to comply with a legal obligation; or (ix) for lawful internal uses that are compatible with the context in which 3M obtained the information.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure.</strong> Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, you have the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information (as defined under applicable local laws). However, as stated above, we do not use or disclose your sensitive personal information for purposes except as described herein (and as permitted pursuant to applicable law, including where applicable the CCPA).&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> The right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment for exercising rights under the applicable privacy laws.</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> Subject to applicable laws, the right to opt out of certain types of processing, including:&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>to opt out of the “sale” (as such term is defined under applicable law) of your personal information.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>to opt out of targeted advertising by us (or for California users: to opt out of “sharing” (as defined under CCPA) of your personal information).&nbsp;</li>
		<li>to opt out of any processing of personal information for purposes of making decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>GPC and Cookie Opt-out.</strong> Our U.S. Internet Site responds to global privacy control—or “GPC”—signals, which means that if we detect that your browser is communicating a GPC signal, we will, subject to applicable law, process that as a request to opt that particular browser and device out of sales and sharing on our Internet Sites. Certain residents may also opt out of any cookie and pixel related “sales” and “sharing” or targeted advertising on any of our Internet Sites by adjusting your cookie privacy preferences for that Internet Site, in our cookie preference manager, which you can access by clicking the “Privacy Choices” link, accessible in the footer of our Internet Sites. Note that if you come back to our Internet Sites from a different device or use a different browser on the same device, you will need to enable GPC or set your cookie preferences for each browser and device you use to access our Internet Sites and services. &nbsp;More information about GPC is available at: <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, you may exercise the right to opt out online by submitting an opt out request via our <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/050ed0e7-c955-4262-942e-02b7aff43a71" target="_blank">request form</a>, or by calling us at toll free at 1-833-256-1792. We will process your request with respect to the personal information in our records that is linked or reasonably linkable to the personal information provided in your request.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mobile Device Settings.</strong> You may use mobile device settings to limit mobile tracking technologies and associated activities. For instance, Android users can visit Google settings &gt; Ads &gt; Reset advertising ID to adjust or reset the advertising identifiers on their mobile device in the device settings. Apple users can go to settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking, and turn off “tracking” to limit apps from tracking their activities across apps and websites for targeted advertising.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Right to Appeal.</strong> &nbsp;If we deny your privacy rights request, you may, depending on applicable law, also appeal our decision by submitting your appeal through our <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/050ed0e7-c955-4262-942e-02b7aff43a71" target="_blank">request form</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Marketing communications.</strong> You can opt out of receiving direct marketing emails from us at any time by using the unsubscribe link in the footer of each marketing email we send to you.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verifying your request.</strong>&nbsp;We will take steps to verify your request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. Your request must:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
	<li>Describe your request with sufficient details that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Please note, in some cases, we may request additional information in order to verify your request or where necessary to process your request. Authorized agents may initiate a request on behalf of another individual through one of the above methods; authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization and we may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent.</p>
