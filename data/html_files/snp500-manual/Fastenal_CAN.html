In no event will Fastenal Canada be responsible for any loss or damage arising out of Purchaser's improper selection, misapplication or misuse of a Product.</span></p>

            <p>Applies to all customers obtaining services from Fastenal.</p>
<p>Thank you for selecting Fastenal to service or repair the tool(s) you ("Purchaser") are submitting. Fastenal's Service Center will be inspecting, and, as you requested, completing the appropriate estimates, repairs and services to the tools submitted or goods you request Fastenal to inspect, repair or recondition ("Tool(s)") in a manner that is consistent with industry standards. Please understand, not every Tool may be repairable, but it is our intention to provide you with the services you've requested. In connection with the services we will be providing, the following terms will apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>All estimates, repairs and service to the Tools will be conducted in conjunction with relevant industry standards. Any estimates provided will become invalid after the Tool is returned to the Purchaser.</li>
<li>All Tools received will be repaired up to the FastFix Rate, WITHOUT an estimate. FastFix Rate pricing is based on average repair charges performed on industrial grade Tools. The actual repair charges could vary for Tools needing only minor repairs versus major repairs.</li>
<li>Upon the successful repair of a Tool, it will be returned to the Purchaser in good working order. The following Limited Warranty replaces the Limited Warranty in the Terms of Purchase and will apply to the Tools repaired:
<ul>
<li>The repairs and parts for all Tools repaired by Fastenal are warranted for 90 days from the date of repair, unless otherwise expressly stated in writing. Fastenal will repair, during the period stated above, without charge, any defects due to faulty material or workmanship concerning the repairs performed. This warranty does not apply to accessories, damage caused by repairs made or attempted by others, alterations, or misuse.</li>
<li>THIS WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS AND OF ALL OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILTIES ON OUR PART, INCLUDING RESPONSIBILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. The remedies provided herein are exclusive. This warranty gives Purchaser specific rights and you may have other rights, which may vary in certain states or provinces. IN NO EVENT WILL FASTENAL'S LIABILITY OR DAMAGES FOR THE SERVICES PERFORMED EXCEED THE FEES OR CHARGES PAID AND RE-PERFORMANCE OR REFUND OF AMOUNTS PAID BY PURCHASER WILL BE THE PURCHASER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the Tool being serviced or repaired is covered under a manufacturer's warranty, Fastenal will perform such work in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures. In addition to the warranties provided under provision 3 above, the Purchaser may be entitled to additional warranties as afforded by the manufacturer. Please consult the manufacturer's terms of sale for further details. Fastenal reserves the right to charge a handling fee for warranty repairs as required.</li>
<li>Provided a Tool is not repaired or cannot be repaired within the value range selected by the Purchaser, the Tool will be returned to the Purchaser (unless Purchaser specifically requests the Tool be discarded) and the Purchaser will be responsible for an Inspection Fee charged by Fastenal. The Tool will not be reassembled. Upon return of the repaired Tool, the Purchaser agrees and understands the following:
<ul>
<li>This Tool has not been repaired by Fastenal and it is returned to the Purchaser. This Tool may contain defects or faults and is not in good working order. It is recommended that this Tool be serviced or repaired prior to using it for the purpose it was intended, or to properly dispose of the unrepaired Tool. Upon receipt of this Tool, the Purchaser assumes all risk of loss, liability or injury arising out of use of the Tool by the Purchaser, its employees, or third parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purchaser must pick up the Tool promptly from our branch location after it is returned. All fees and costs of repairs must be paid before the Tool will be returned to Purchaser. If Purchaser fails to pick up your Tool within six (6) months from the date the Tool is returned to the branch, the Tool will be deemed abandoned and Fastenal will dispose of the Tool at its discretion, with any proceeds applied to fees and handling costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Terms of Purchase will apply to all Orders for Tool service and the Terms of Tool and Repair Service will be in addition to such Terms of Purchase, unless stated otherwise herein. In the event of conflict between the Term of Purchase and the Terms of Tool and Repair Service, these Terms of Tool and Repair Service shall prevail for the performance of services by Fastenal. If you have any questions concerning the terms of service noted above, please contact your local Fastenal branch.</p>

<p>At Fastenal Company, including its subsidiaries ('Fastenal'), we are committed to operational excellence, ethical and responsible conduct, fair and respectful treatment of all individuals, and practices that promote safety, health and environmental protection.&nbsp;In addition to our core values, ambition, integrity, innovation and teamwork, we stand by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles">Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact</a> in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption as derived from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" target="_self">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/rio20/futurewewant" target="_blank">Rio Declaration on Environment and Development</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html" target="_blank">United Nations Convention Against Corruption</a>.</p>
<p>Fastenal expects all product and service providers, vendors or suppliers whom we do business with (“Suppliers”) to share these commitments to meet the following standards in all activities that relate to our company. Conformance to this Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) is required to become or maintain good standing as a supplier to Fastenal for any supplied material or service. We will evaluate Suppliers’ compliance with these standards in determining whether to grant or continue preferred status. Suppliers that do not comply with the foregoing Code of Conduct may be disqualified from preferred status and/or have their business relationship with Fastenal terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation.</strong>&nbsp;Supplier must comply with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations – including those relating to minimum wages, overtime, and other elements of compensation – and will provide all legally mandated benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Hours of Work.</strong>&nbsp;Supplier will maintain work hours in compliance with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations. Supplier will not require employees to work more than any limits on regular and overtime hours allowed by any applicable local law.</p>
<p><b>Forced / Prison Labor</b>.&nbsp;Supplier will not use forced or involuntary labor, including prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor, or any other type of labor associated with human trafficking or abuse.&nbsp; Supplier will additionally ensure that proper controls are in place to prevent the introduction of forced labor into any upstream portion of the supply chain and will immediately notify Fastenal regarding any known or suspected instances of forced labor.</p>
<p>There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company-provided facilities. Working hours are not to exceed the maximum set by local law. Workers shall be allowed mandated breaks, holiday and vacation days to which they are legally entitled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Child Labor.</strong>&nbsp;Supplier will not use child labor. “Child” is any person who is either (1) younger than 16, or (2) younger than the minimum age required for the employment under applicable law. Supplier will comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the employment of minors.</p>
<p><strong>Coercion and Harassment.</strong>&nbsp;Supplier will treat each employee with dignity and respect, and will not engage in or permit corporal punishment, threats of violence, or other forms of harassment whether based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability, age, or any other legally protected characteristic. Disciplinary policies and procedures in support of these requirements shall be clearly defined and communicated to workers.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring and Compliance.</strong>&nbsp;Supplier understands that Fastenal or our designated agents (including third parties) may engage in monitoring activities to assess compliance with this Code of Conduct including on-site inspection of facilities and review of books and records.&nbsp;<strong><i>Neither Fastenal nor any of its authorized agents assumes any duty to monitor or ensure compliance with this Code of Conduct. The Supplier understands that Supplier is solely responsible for full compliance with this Code of Conduct by its officers, directors, managers, employees, representatives and agents.</i></strong></p>

Each scenario will be assessed and handled according to Fastenal’s supply chain policies and channeled through applicable Supplier Development Management teams for resolution.</p>

                <h4>Conflict Minerals</h4>
                <p>“Conflict Minerals” refers to tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, which are derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite, regardless of where they are sourced, processed or sold. There is an increasing awareness of violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from an area described as the “Conflict Region”, located in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. As a result, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (”Act”) of 2010 directed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to adopt rules to implement disclosure requirements related to these “Conflict Minerals”. These rules apply to manufacturers who file periodic reports with the SEC and who manufacture or contract to manufacture products containing “conflict minerals” that are “necessary to the functionality or production” of those products. These manufacturers are required to make inquiries as to the origin of these “conflict minerals” and file a report with the SEC to describe and disclose the results of those inquiries.</p>
<p>To ensure compliance with the Act, our Sellers are required to undertake reasonable due diligence with their supply chains to determine whether the specified metals, if any exist in their respective products, are being sourced from:</p>
<p>1. Mines and smelters outside the Conflict Region&nbsp;or<br> 2. Mines and smelters which have been certified by an independent third party as “conflict free”, if sourced within the Conflict Region.</p>
<p>Sellers are required to provide written documentation to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:conflictminerals@fastenal.com">conflictminerals@fastenal.com</a>&nbsp;to confirm whether the raw materials tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold used in the manufacture of the products supplied to Fastenal originated from outside the Conflict Region or, if the raw material originated from within the Conflict Region, that the mines or smelters are certified as “conflict free” by an independent third party. Fastenal’s Conflict Mineral Reports are available on the Investor Relations page:&nbsp;<a href="http://investor.fastenal.com/" target="_blank">investor.fastenal.com</a>.</p>

                <h4>California Proposition 65</h4>
                <p>Proposition 65, the Safe and Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The Proposition was intended to protect California (USA) citizens and the State’s drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals. In order to notify customers of possible exposure at the point of sale and on Fastenal.com, Seller must notify Fastenal (<a href="mailto:productcompliance@fastenal.com">productcompliance@fastenal.com</a>) if product contains chemicals covered by this Act that meet or exceed Safe Harbor levels that require a ‘reasonable warning’ and validate that the items are properly labeled for sale in California (USA). The list of chemicals and metals covered by Prop 65 now exceeds 900, and the list continues to grow every year.
