<p>We use the personal information you provide to us (either orally, in writing, through your use of our website, or as a result of our dealings with you) and any data we obtain from third parties to provide the service requested by you.</p>

<p>We recognise that we have a legitimate interest in processing the personal data we collect about you for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: marketing purposes, to enable us to enhance, modify, personalise, or otherwise improve our services, identify and prevent fraud, enhance and protect the security of our network and systems, and market research. “Legitimate interests” means the interests of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and most secure experience.</p>

<p>When we use your information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you and your data protection rights. Where applicable, legitimate interest assessments are conducted to ensure that these rights are protected.</p>

<p><u>Privacy Rights</u></p>

The minimum period tends to be for six years but can be longer if the statute or regulation requires</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</em></p>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA grants certain California residents five new rights respecting their personal information. If you are a California resident, you may have the following rights:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The right to request more information about Sysco’s data collection and sales practices in connection with your personal information, including the categories of personal information Sysco has collected, the source of the information, Sysco’s use of the information and, if the information was disclosed or sold to third parties, the categories of personal information disclosed or sold to third parties and the categories of third parties to whom such information was disclosed or sold;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The right to request a copy of the specific personal information collected about you during the 12 months before your request (together with right #1, a “personal information request”). You may only make a personal information request twice in a 12-month period, and Sysco will respond within 45 days of receiving a personal information request;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The right to request that personal information be deleted (with exceptions);</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The right to request that your personal information not be sold to third parties, if applicable; and</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The right not to be discriminated against because you exercise any of the new rights.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Sysco does not rent, sell, or share personal information (as defined by California Civil Code §1798.83) about you that we collect on the Site with other people or unaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission, and Sysco has not “sold” (as that term is defined in the CCPA) your personal information in the last 12 months</p>

<p>Note that, in connection with the exercise of the above rights, Sysco may need to collect information from you so that Sysco can verify your identity.</p>

<p>You may exercise these rights by contacting us. Please go to <strong>REPORTING &amp; INVESTIGATIONS</strong> for additional information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please use the Contact Us email below if you have concerns regarding the potential collection of your child’s information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>OTHER PRIVACY RIGHTS</em></p>

<p>In addition to the jurisdictions addressed above, other jurisdictions have specific legal requirements and grant specific privacy rights, and we will comply with restrictions and any requests you submit as required by the applicable law. For example, you may have the right to review, correct, and delete personal information we have about you, or to consent or withdraw consent to certain uses or sharing of personal information. If you would like to request access to personal information that we maintain, or to request that we update, correct, or delete your personal information, please go to Reporting and Investigations for additional contact information.
