<p><strong>International Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement describes our policies and procedures in the United States and Canada. We are a global company, and personal information we collect in the United States and Canada may be transferred to other jurisdictions (such as the United States, Canada, or the European Union) as permitted by law, for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement, and the information may become subject to the laws of those jurisdictions and accessible to authorities in those jurisdictions.</p>

<li>by mail at: VF Corporation, Attn: Privacy Officer, 105 Corporate Center Blvd., Greensboro, North Carolina, USA 27408.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request to Know</strong>: You may ask us to furnish you with (i) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of personal information we have collected about you; (iii) the categories of sources from which we collect information about you; (iv) the business or commercial purposes for collecting information about you; or (v) the categories of third parties with whom we share or have shared personal information about you.</li>

If you opt in to any such incentive program, you may opt out at any time, as described in the terms and conditions of those programs, though you may lose the benefits associated with the incentive if you require us to delete your information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Information regarding the consumer privacy requests we received in the prior calendar year is available&nbsp;</span><a href="/privacy-requests/vf-corporation-annual-report-of-privacy-requests-in-north-america" rel="noreferrer" heap-ignore="true"><span>here.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>How Your Identity Will Be Verified</strong></p>
<p>For your privacy and security, and to prevent fraud and other harmful activities, when we receive a request through one of the Communication Methods, we may need to ensure that the person submitting the request is the person they purport to be. Accordingly, we may take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person submitting the request, as further described in our <a href="https://www.vfc.com/privacy-requests">privacy request web portal</a>. If we ask you to verify your identity, you must promptly cooperate with our efforts so that we can fulfill your request.</p>
<p><strong>Requests from Authorized Agents</strong></p>
<p>If you submit a consumer privacy request on behalf of another person, you must verify your legal authority to act on behalf of that person, and your identity and the identity of the other person, to our satisfaction before we can fulfill your request.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Opt Out of Online Advertising or Other Promotional Communications</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the options described above, you can take other steps to limit the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. You can manage how your device, mobile browser and other devices share information with our websites and mobile apps, as well as how your browser handles cookies and other tracking technologies, by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device. Please refer to instructions provided by your service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings. Our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize an Internet browser’s “Do Not Track” signals, and we cannot follow those signals.&nbsp; Several of the companies that utilize cookies or other tracking or monitoring mechanisms enable you to opt out of advertising through mechanisms established by trade groups. If you wish to reduce this type of third-party, interest-based advertising, you may opt out of advertising from members of the National Advertising Initiative&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens in a new window">here</a>, and from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;<a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens in a new window">here</a> (for US) or <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens in a new window">here</a> (for Canada). Please note the links in the prior sentence will not opt you out of receiving all marketing communications from us. There are other ways in which you can tell us whether or not you want to receive promotional communications from us. When you set up an account or log into your account on our websites or mobile applications, you may have an opportunity to make or change your selections with respect to each brand. You also will have an opportunity to opt-out of advertising email messages from us by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in commercial e-mails those brands send you. If you receive a text message (SMS or MMS) from one of our brands and would like to opt out of receiving further text messages, you may do so by following the opt-out instructions within the text message.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>We will review our Privacy Statement periodically (at least annually), and we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to revise, change or modify this Privacy Statement at any time. &nbsp;We will post any changes to this Privacy Statement on our websites and they will be effective as of the date of posting. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review this information. By engaging with us, including by visiting our website(s) or mobile application(s), after this Privacy Statement has been updated, you agree to the updated terms of this Privacy Statement. &nbsp;This Privacy Statement was last updated on March 23, 2022.</p>
