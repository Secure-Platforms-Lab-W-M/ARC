The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule provides individuals with the right to receive a notice that describes (1) how their individual health information, personal information and other protected health information (“PHI”) may be used and/or disclosed, (2) their privacy rights with respect to their PHI (including their right to access their PHI and other rights), and (3) Aflac’s obligations with respect to that information. Aflac is fully committed to its compliance with the HIPAA Rules, including the Privacy Rule, in safeguarding PHI. <br> <br> For its HIPAA-covered insurance policies, Aflac is federally mandated to send a notice (Notice of Privacy Practices) to its insureds and to post the notice on its website. You should be aware that your state law may provide additional access and amendment rights to you, which differ from those granted by HIPAA. If you would like additional information concerning the collection and disclosure of PHI and your rights under state law to access and amend such information, it will be furnished upon request. Please e-mail your request to <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@aflac.com" title="Email: privacyoffice@aflac.com">privacyoffice@aflac.com</a>.

<p>(i) <strong>How We Will Verify Your Identity:</strong> Only you, or an authorized agent, may submit a request to know, to correct, or to delete your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will use the personal information you provide to us when submitting a consumer request only to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>We will require the following information to verify your identity:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>For requests made online:</span> We will require you to upload a photo identification card (passport, driving license) so that we can correctly match it with information we have previously collected about you. We will also require you to attest that you are the person you claim to be.</li>
<li><span>For requests made by phone:</span> In order to submit your request over the phone, you must have a valid phone number and a valid email address.</li>
<li><span>For requests made by mail:</span> You must submit proof of your identity.</li>
<li><span>Additional information we may request to verify your identity:</span> When we request additional information from you to verify your identity, we may request other account information, answers to security questions, your name, government identification number, date of birth, contact information, or other personal identifying information.</li>
</ul>
<p>(j) <strong>How We Will Respond to Your Request:</strong> We intend to confirm receipt of your request to know, delete, or correct your personal information within 10 days and to respond to a verified request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For requests to know the specific pieces of information we have collected, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p>(k) Residents of the State of California may request a list of categories of all third-parties with whom our Site has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third-parties’ direct marketing purposes.
