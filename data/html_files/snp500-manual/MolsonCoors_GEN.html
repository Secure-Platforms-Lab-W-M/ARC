		Although the above chart describes examples of personal information we collect and our primary purpose in collecting such personal information, in many situations we have more than one legitimate purpose. For example, if you complete an online order, we collect your payment (directly through our payment processor) and shipping information to perform our contract with you (e.g., to process and fulfill your order), but we also collect your personal information because we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your personal information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your personal information is based in different contexts upon: (i) your consent (e.g., for marketing you have opted-in to receive, where required), (ii) the performance of our contract with you (e.g., to provide you with products and services you have requested); (iii) compliance with legal obligations (e.g., where we are required to disclose information to a court or tax authority); and/or (iv) our legitimate interests in conducting our business.</p>

		<p>To the extent that any information is considered “personal information” by local law, we treat this information as such and ensure that our handling of this personal information complies with all applicable data privacy and protection laws. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any information you provide to us directly may be combined with other information that you provide to us through other channels, that is publicly available, or that we may otherwise obtain, including from third parties.<br>

			<li><strong>Offline</strong> (e.g., customer service inquiries, tours, sweepstakes);</li>
			<li><strong>Online tracking technologies, including cross-device tracking</strong> (e.g., service file logs, IP address, cookies, tags, pixels, clear pixels, gifs, bugs, beacons, and other similar technologies, some of which may enable Molson Coors or our service providers to identify you and collect personal information about you across devices and Sites);</li>

	<h2><u>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION/DISCLOSURE TO THIRD-PARTIES</u></h2>

	<p>At times, Molson Coors may make certain personal information available to third parties and within our family of companies/brands. In addition to the specific situations described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we disclose personal information in the following situations as permitted by applicable law.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>

	<ul><li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We share personal information with our corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies and brands under common control).</li>
		<li><strong>Marketing Partners.</strong> We share personal information with vendors/providers that help us to evaluate and improve our marketing and promotional efforts, content, products and services, to better understand customer interests and preferences, to provide you relevant information, and to conduct joint marketing programs.</li>
		<li><strong>Service Vendors/Providers.</strong> We share personal information with service vendors/providers that help us with certain business activities, including but not limited to fulfilling and shipping your order, assisting us in Site operations, administer promotions, providing customer service, and delivering email communications.</li>
		<li><strong>Corporate Change.</strong> We may share personal information in connection with a corporate change including a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, including during the planning and negotiation stages.</li>
		<li><strong>Third-party Partners.</strong> We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party, the personal information that you provide will be shared with us and them. Some jurisdictions require the sharing of personal information related to prizes and awards. Their use of your personal information is not governed by this Privacy Policy. We also share personal information with other third-party partners with whom we may enter into a relationship (e.g., sports alliances). Depending on the purposes for this sharing, Molson Coors may provide you with the option of whether this personal information may be shared prior to sharing with such a partner. The subsequent use of the personal information by the third-party partner will be governed by their own privacy practices and policies.</li>
		<li><strong>Public.</strong> Some of our Sites permit you to engage with or post on our social media pages and blogs, and other similar platforms. When you post on social networking platforms or other public platforms, the personal information that you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by other users. For example, if you list your name, age, and address on a social media site, this personal information is public. Please be aware that the privacy policy of the social networking site will apply to any content you post on or provide to that Site.</li>
		<li><strong>Certain Other Disclosures with Your Consent.</strong> We may ask if you would like us to share your personal information with other third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy with your prior formal consent to do so.</li>
		<li><strong>Certain Other Disclosures Without Your Consent.</strong> We may disclose personal information as required by law, such as in conjunction with a government inquiry or to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or similar legal process. We may also share your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to protect your safety or the safety of us or others, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, or a violation of our policies.<br>

	<h2><u>SECURITY AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION</u></h2>

	<p>Please be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. If you have reason to believe that your personal information is not secure, please contact us immediately in accordance with the contact information below. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>

	<p>We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Privacy Policy. In some circumstances, we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance, where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements.<br>
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h2><u>THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS/WEBSITES</u></h2>

	<ol type="A"><li><u>Social Networks/Online Communities</u>

		<p>On certain Sites, we may enable you to access online communities for sharing information such as messages, photos, and videos. We may also enable you to post content from some Sites to your profile on other social networks. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third-party social networks. For example, sharing such information with a social media site may require us to implement cookies and/or APIs in order to facilitate the communication between our Sites and the social media site. That information, shared through cookies and/or APIs, then becomes subject to that third party site’s privacy policy. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third-party social network, which you use at your own risk.<br><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Linked Sites</u>
		<p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites or applications not controlled by Molson Coors or covered by this Privacy Policy. If you submit information to any of those websites or applications, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website or application that you visit. We have no control or authority over third-party sites and are not responsible for any information that you may submit on that site.<br>
		&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Widgets and Interactive Applications</u>
		<p>Our Sites may include interactive programs that provide specific services from another company, such as “liking” or sharing content, often referred to as widgets. You may have the opportunity to submit information, such as your email or phone number for collection through a widget. A widget may also use cookies and/or collect usage data. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.<br>

	<h2><u>INFORMATION FOR UK AND EU RESIDENTS</u></h2>

	<ol type="A"><li><u>Legal Basis for Processing.</u> As described above, our processing (i.e., collection and use) of your personal information is based on one of a number of legal conditions. Generally, these include:

		<ul><li>Your consent (for example, to receive marketing communications from us);</li>
			<li>The performance of our contract with you (e.g., to process your payment or shipping information in order to fulfil your order);</li>
			<li>Compliance with a legal obligation (e.g., where we are required to disclose personal information to a court or a tax authority); and</li>
			<li>Our legitimate interests, provided these do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., where we carry out research and analysis to improve our Site, products and services).<br><br>
			&nbsp;</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><u>Rights of UK and EU Residents.</u> Subject to applicable law (including certain exceptions and qualifications), as a resident of the United Kingdom or the EU, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information. These rights may include some of the following:
		<ul><li>To obtain a copy of your personal information together with information about how and on what basis that personal information is processed;</li>
			<li>To rectify inaccurate personal information (including the right to have incomplete personal information completed);</li>
			<li>To erase your personal information (in limited circumstances, such as where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);</li>
			<li>To restrict processing of your personal information where:
			<ul><li>The accuracy of the personal information is contested;</li>
				<li>The processing is unlawful but you object to the erasure of the personal information; or</li>
				<li>We no longer require the personal information, but it is still required for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim;</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>To challenge processing which we have justified based on a legitimate interest (as opposed to your consent, or to perform a contract with you);</li>
			<li>To prevent us from sending you direct marketing;</li>
			<li>To withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information (where that processing is based on your consent);</li>
			<li>To object to decisions which are based solely on automated processing or profiling; and and</li>
			<li>To obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal information is transferred to a third country or international organization.<br>
			&nbsp;</li>
		</ul><p>In addition to the above, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority, depending on where you have your habitual residence or place of work, or where an alleged infringement of applicable data protection law occurs (for example, the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom, contactable at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="www.ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a>). For the EEA, a list of data protection authorities is available at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" target="_blank" title="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en</a>.</p>

		<p>Each Molson Coors data controller can be contacted through our shared mailbox at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@molsoncoors.com">dataprotection@molsoncoors.com</a>. If you have a contractual relationship with us, the Molson Coors group company identified in that contract (whether issued by us or a third party) will be data controller of your information.]<br>
		&nbsp;</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Exercising Your Rights.</u> If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please submit a request using the contact details in the “Privacy Inquiries” section above. Please note we will request proof of your identity, and verify such identity in order to protect your personal information and ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and policies. In some cases, we may limit or deny requests where permitted or required by law. For example, except where disclosure is required by law, we may decide not to grant access or make revisions where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given case, or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access. Additionally, we may deny a request if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, including for example, if your request is manifestly excessive or unfounded. We will respond to your requests within the applicable timeframes and consistent with applicable regulations.<br><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
		<li><u>International Transfers for UK and EU Residents&nbsp;</u>You should be aware that Molson Coors is headquartered in the United States with corporate offices abroad. Your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States for processing. Additionally, any personal information that you provide to or that is collected by or on behalf of Molson Coors may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world consistent with the practices described within this Privacy Policy. The privacy laws in these countries may be less stringent than the laws in your country of residence. In relation to both internal transfers and the use of affiliates, service providers or suppliers, for personal information that is transferred outside of the UK and the European Economic Area ("EEA"), we rely on adequate measures such as the EU Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses, which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK and the EEA. You may have a right to request additional details about the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside of the UK and the EEA. If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information above.<br>

When you sign up for one of these Programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address, home or physical address, etc.) to contact you regarding your participation in the program. Because our Programs involve the collection of personal information, they might be interpreted as a “financial incentive” program under California law. The value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as part of the applicable Program. This value is based on the expense related to offering those products, services, and benefits to Program participants. You may withdraw from participating in a Program at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable Program rules. Visit the terms and conditions page of each Program to view full details, including how to join.<br>
