    <td width="126"><br>
      <strong>Legitimate    Interests</strong></td>
    <td width="468"><p>Where we are processing Personal Information based    on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a    reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into    account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data    subjects</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="126"><p><strong>Consent</strong></p></td>
    <td width="468"><p>Where we are processing Personal Information based    on your consent, we generally will retain the information for the period of    time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you, subject to your    right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your data erased    (please see Region-Specific Disclosures section below)</p></td>
