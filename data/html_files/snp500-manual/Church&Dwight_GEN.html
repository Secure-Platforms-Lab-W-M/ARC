On our Site, we and third parties (such as ad  networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms)  may collect information about your online activities over time and across our  Site and third-party websites, to provide you with advertising about products  and services tailored to your interests. We also may share the information we  collect about you and your online activities with third parties for  interest-based advertising purposes. You may see certain ads on other websites  based on your visits to our Site because we participate in advertising networks  administered by third-party vendors. Ad networks allow us to target our  messaging to users considering demographic data, users' inferred interests and  browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by  collecting information through automated means, including through the use of  cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The networks use this information to  show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The  information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your  visits to websites that participate in the vendors' advertising networks, such  as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the  websites. This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party  websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
