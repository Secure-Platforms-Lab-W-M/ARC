<br><br><p>Last Updated: December 2022</p>

<p>Willis Towers Watson (collectively, “we,” “us”,” or “WTW”) operate worldwide through subsidiary and affiliate companies. We are committed to privacy and to transparency in our information practices.  In this privacy notice, we describe our collection, use, disclosure and processing of personal information that we collect online via our websites, as well as related to our products and services.</p>


<h3>1. Scope</h3>

<p>This privacy notice describes, generally, how Willis Towers Watson, in our capacity as a “controller” or a “business” or a “responsible party” under applicable laws, handles and processes personal information related to:</p>

<ul>
<li>the use of our websites, marketing communications and associated services that link to this privacy notice, including  <a href="https://www.wtwco.com/en-GB/">www.wtwco.com</a> (the “Homepage”) and other websites controlled by Willis Towers Watson (collectively, the “<strong>Websites</strong>”)</li>
<li>our former, current and prospective clients</li>
<li>individuals who communicate with us</li>
<li>individuals who use our products and services (“<strong>Services</strong>”) and individuals whose personal information we receive in providing the Services</li>
</ul>

<p>Our collection, use and disclosure and processing of personal information about individuals will vary depending upon the circumstances.  This privacy notice is intended to describe our overall privacy and data protection practices.  In some cases, different or additional notices about our data collection and processing practices may be provided and apply to our processing of certain personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Personal information</strong>. In this privacy notice, our use of the term “personal information” includes other similar terms under applicable privacy laws—such as “personal data” and “personally identifiable information.”  In general, personal information includes any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated, linked, or linkable with a particular individual.  </p>

<p>In South Africa only, “personal information” also includes information of juristic persons, the most common example being a company.</p>

<p><strong>Not covered by this notice</strong>. This privacy notice does not apply to job applicants and candidates who apply for employment with us through our <a href="https://careers.wtwco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job application portal</a> or to our employees and non-employee workers whose personal information is subject to different privacy notices which are provided to such individuals in the context of their employment or working relationship with a Willis Towers Watson group entity.</p>

<h3>2. Controller and Responsible Willis Towers Watson Group Entities</h3>

<p>When providing Services to clients, Willis Towers Watson may act as a “service provider” or “processor” or “operator” under applicable privacy and data protection laws. This means that we may receive or collect your personal information from or on behalf of our client.  In this scenario, we will only process personal information on behalf of and subject to the instructions of our clients (who, from a privacy law perspective, are “controllers” or “businesses” or “responsible parties” with respect to the personal information we process on their behalf).  In some cases, where we are acting as a “service provider” or “processor” or “operator,” our clients’ privacy notices (and not this one) will apply to and control the processing of personal information.  If you have any questions which privacy notice may apply, please contact us as at <a href="mailto:privacy@willistowerswatson.com">privacy@wtwco.com</a>.</p>

<p>Where we act in our capacity as a controller or business or responsible party with respect to personal information, for the purposes of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”) and other relevant applicable laws, including but not limited to the Cayman Islands Data Protection Law (“<strong>DPL</strong>”), this privacy notice will apply, as explained below.  Furthermore, Willis Towers Watson plc is the controller unless the processing is controlled by another Willis Towers Watson entity.  </p>

<p><strong>Our Websites</strong>.

<p>In this section, we set forth additional information as required under applicable privacy laws in certain jurisdictions.</p>

<p><strong>A. California Residents</strong></p>

<p>In this section, we provide information for California residents as required under California privacy laws, including the CCPA, which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline. This section does not address or apply to our handling of:</p>

<ul>
<li>publicly available information made lawfully available by state or federal governments</li>
<li>personal information that is subject to an exemption under Section 1798.145(c) – (f) of the CCPA (such as protected health information that is subject to HIPAA or the California Medical Information Act, and non-public information subject to the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act or the California Financial Information Privacy Act)</li>
<li>personal information we collect about job applicants, independent contractors, or current or former full-time, part-time and temporary employees and staff, officers, directors or owners of Willis Towers Watson</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Categories of personal information that we collect and disclose</strong>. Our collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a California resident will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of our interactions or relationship with such resident.  The sections above set out generally the categories of personal information (as defined by the CCPA) about California residents that we collect, sell, and disclose to others for a business purpose.  We collect these categories of personal information from the sources described in the <a href="#_Personal_Information_Collected">Personal information we may collect</a> section above, and for the purposes described in the <a href="#_Purposes_and_Legal">Purposes for which we use personal information</a> section above. We process personal data belonging to individuals 16 years or younger.</p>

<p><strong>Rights of California residents</strong>. California law grants California residents certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do-Not-Sell</strong>: California residents have the right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information. Opt-out rights can be exercised by clicking the Do Not Sell My Information link in the footer of our <a href="https://www.wtwco.com/en-GB/">Website Homepage</a>. If you have reached this Privacy Notice from a website other than our Homepage, please go back and use the cookie preference manager on that website to exercise your opt-out rights to the extent they may apply on that website.  We do not sell personal information about residents who we know are younger than 16 years old without opt-in consent. </li>

<li><strong>Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information</strong>: California residents have the right in certain instances to request that we limit the use and sharing of their sensitive personal information. The CCPA defines “sensitive personal information” to include, among other things, your: social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport numbers; account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card numbers in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; genetic data; and biometric information (including physiological, biological, or behavioral characteristics).

<li><strong>Initial Notice</strong>: We are required to notify California residents, at or before the point of collection of their personal information, the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which such information is used.</li>

<li><strong>Request to Delete</strong>: California residents have the right to request deletion of their personal information that we have collected about them and to have such personal information deleted, except where an exemption applies.

The instructions for submitting a verifiable Request to Delete are described in the “Submitting Requests” section below.     </li>


<li><strong>Request to Know</strong>: California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about them and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.  California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information, including the: 

<ul>
<li>categories of personal information collected;</li>
<li>categories of sources of personal information;</li>
<li>business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;</li>

<li><strong>Financial Incentives</strong>: A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, where the incentive is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent.
