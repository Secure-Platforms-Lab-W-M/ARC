<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Limit Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information</b></p>
<p>California residents have the right to limit our use of their sensitive personal information if we use such personal information to infer characteristics about them.

<p><b><u><a></a>Sale and Sharing of Personal Information;</u> <u>Targeted Advertising</u></b></p>
<p>Under the laws of some states, consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information or the sharing of their personal information with third parties for targeted advertising (also known as cross-context behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may allow third-party companies to collect information about your activity on our website, for example, through cookies, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins. These advertising entities use Information they collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You can control the sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising through our websites in the following ways:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, click <a></a><a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/legal/privacy-policy#cookiePopup">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal information collected through these methods is associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to opt out for this information you will need to disable cookies or trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, if you clear your cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so you must opt out again. You may also disable non-advertising cookies through your browser or device settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In applicable states, where required, Activision Blizzard recognizes Do Not Track settings and the Global Privacy Control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our Properties, as well as other online properties which we do not control. To help select the ads of greatest interest to you, these companies may use Cookies to collect and track information such as demographic data (e.g., gender, occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location and device-related data (for example, browser type, language, IP address, time/date) to select advertisements that are more relevant to your interests,&nbsp;and to better personalize the experience for you. In some instances, third-parties may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymized or device-related information about your visits to the Properties in order to monitor the effectiveness of the ads (e.g., by using analytics Cookies) and to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about Advertising Cookies and your opt-out choices, visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at&nbsp;<a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">http://networkadvertising.org</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://youronlinechoices.com/">http://youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard may use and share anonymized or aggregated information obtained from Cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising partners. For example, we may use&nbsp;&nbsp;information such as interests to group you with other people with similar interests or preferences and place you into a market segment. We may then display advertisements which we believe people in your market segment will find relevant. We may also share personal and non-personal information obtained from cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising networks in order to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving advertisements for us or our advertising partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flash Cookies, Web Beacons, IP Addresses</b></p>
<p>Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows sites to deploy dynamic web content. For example, we may use Flash Cookies to deliver video content to you on our Properties. Adobe Flash and similar applications use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage in ways that are similar to browser Cookies, but are managed through a different interface than your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</a>&nbsp;directly to manage your Cookie settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time, we may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our Properties or include them in the email messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs",&nbsp;""pixel tags""&nbsp;or&nbsp;"pixels")")&nbsp;are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer when you log on to the Internet. For example, we may use these in emails to understand and analyze whether the email was opened or any links were clicked, in order to improve our future communications with you and other users. As a web beacon forms part of a webpage or email it does not have the same opt out options as other Cookies. Generally, you can render them ineffective by opting out of any Cookies they set, by turning off images in your email service, or by viewing your emails as “text” rather than “HTML.” For more information on how to opt out of Cookies see the Managing Cookies and Do Not Track Options section below, and for more information on how to turn off images in your emails or to view them as text see the “Help” section of your email service provider.</p>
