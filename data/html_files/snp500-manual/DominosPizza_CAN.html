vary by location.  An additional charge may apply for premium toppings, sauces, extra cheese, and special pizza types including: Handmade Pan Pizzas, Thin Crust Pizzas, Gluten Free Pizzas and Feast Pizzas.</p> <p>Please refer to offer when ordering. Limited time. Prices, participation, delivery area, terms and charges may vary.</p> <p>According to our most recent assessment of scientific data, foods containing gluten levels not exceeding 20 PPM would not pose a health risk to the vast majority of individuals with Celiac Disease or to individuals with gluten sensitivity. The level of gluten found in our pizza made with Gluten Free Crust is below 20 PPM. However, Domino's pizza made with a Gluten Free Crust is prepared in a common kitchen with the risk of gluten exposure. Therefore, Domino's DOES NOT recommend this pizza for customers with Celiac Disease. Customers with gluten sensitivities should exercise judgement in consuming this pizza.</p> <p>Domino's Carryout Insurance program is only available to carryout customers who return their damaged order, uneaten, in its original packaging (inclusive of an order label or receipt) to the store from which it was originally purchased within a maximum of two hours of the time of purchase. Damaged orders will be replaced with identical products and no substitutions will be permitted. This is a limited time offer and store participation may vary.</p> <p>Due to baking quality, limit of 10 toppings per pizza.</p>  <p>©2023 Domino's IP Holder LLC.
