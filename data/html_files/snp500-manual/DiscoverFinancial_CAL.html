<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>

<p>Under the CCPA, “Personal Information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked with a particular California resident or household. &nbsp;The CCPA, however, does not apply to certain information, such as information subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”).</p>
<p>As a result, this Disclosure does not apply, for example, with respect to information that we collect about California residents who apply for or obtain our financial products and services for personal, family, or household purposes (“GLBA Consumers”). &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Your Rights Under the CCPA</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights over the Personal Information we have about you.&nbsp; You may request the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The categories of Personal Information that we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected such&nbsp;information;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business or commercial purposes for collecting Personal Information about you; the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such Personal Information (if applicable); the categories of Personal Information that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed that category of Personal Information (if applicable);</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deletion of Personal Information that we collected from you;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correction of Personal Information that may be inaccurate; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitations regarding the use of your Sensitive Personal Information</p>
<p>In some instances, we may decline to honor your request where an exception applies, such as where the disclosure of Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another consumer, where the Personal Information that we maintain about you is not subject to CCPA requirements, or where the Personal Information is a trade secret. &nbsp;We may also decline to honor your request if we cannot verify your identity or confirm that the Personal Information that we maintain relates to you, or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCPA also sets forth exceptions for when a business is not required to delete Personal Information, including but not limited to, where it is reasonably necessary to maintain Personal Information to provide a good or service that you requested, comply with a legal obligation, or to help ensure security and integrity.&nbsp; As you would reasonably expect, the Sensitive Personal Information we collect, use, and disclose is done so to provide goods and services you requested, thus we cannot limit the use of your Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we may decline the request to correct Personal Information depending on the nature of the Personal Information, the accuracy of the request, how the information was obtained and the business purposes for which the information was collected, maintained, or used.&nbsp; To maintain integrity, security and accuracy of your pertinent account information, request for changes may be honored by calling 1-800-Discover or through your account log-in on Discover.com.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</p>
