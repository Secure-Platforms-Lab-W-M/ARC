<p>About us</p>
<div>
<p>This Privacy Notice describes how Arthur J. Gallagher Insurance Brokers (Ireland) Limited (including when conducting business using any of their respective trading names as reflected on the Central Bank of Ireland Register (<a href="https://registers.centralbank.ie/">https://registers.centralbank.ie/</a>)) “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>Gallagher</strong>” collect and process data about individuals. Our services consist primarily of risk consulting, (re)insurance broking and the provision of insurance, which enable the consideration of, access to, administration of, and making of claims on, insurance. We are part of the Arthur J. Gallagher global group of companies.</p>
<p>In order to offer and provide our services, we will collect and use data about individuals. This means that we are a ‘data controller’ and we are responsible for complying with data protection laws. The Gallagher group company which offers to or provides the risk consulting, (re)insurance broking or insurance service to you is primarily responsible for the personal data collected in relation to that offer or service.</p>
<p>During the insurance lifecycle we will receive personal information relating to potential or actual policy holders, policy beneficiaries including their family members as well as claimants and other parties that are involved in a claim. As such, references to “<strong>individuals</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>” in this Privacy Notice include any living individual from the preceding list, whose personal information we receive in connection with the services we provide under our engagement with our clients.</p>
<p>We have appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee our handling of personal information. If you have any questions about how we collect, store or use your personal information, you may contact our Data Protection Officer using the details set out in the <a href="#SectionContacting">“Contacting Us”</a> section.</p>
<p><a href="#top">▲ Back to Top</a></p>
</div>
<p>About the insurance market</p>
<div>
<p>The personal information that we collect and process will be shared with other participants in the insurance market, some of which you will not have direct contact with. You can identify relevant data controllers through the insurance market life-cycle in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Where you took out the insurance policy yourself:</strong> intermediaries such as Gallagher will be the initial data controller. The insurer will also be a data controller. Gallagher’s Data Protection Officer can advise you of the identities of other insurance market participants that have been provided with your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Where your employer or another organisation took out the policy for your benefit:</strong> you should contact your employer or the organisation that took out the policy who should provide you with details of intermediaries such as Gallagher that they provided your personal data to. Gallagher’s Data Protection Officer can advise you of the identities of other insurance market participants that have been provided with your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Where you are not a policyholder or an insured:</strong> you should contact the organisation that collected your personal data who should provide you with details of the relevant data protection contact.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">▲ Back to Top</a></p>
</div>
<p>Our processing of your personal information</p>
<div>
<p>The personal information that we collect will depend on our relationship with you. Please click on the section below that best describes your relationship with us. For example, we will collect more detailed information about you if you are a client than we would if you simply made an enquiry about the services that we offer.</p>
<p>Sometimes we will ask for or obtain special categories of information (information relating to your health, genetic or biometric data, criminal convictions, sex life, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership) because it is relevant to your insurance policy or claim (for example, health information which relates to a life assurance or accident policy) or information regarding criminal convictions for the purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating fraud.</p>
<p>If you provide personal information to us about other people you must provide them with a copy of this Privacy Notice and obtain any consent where we indicate that it is required for the processing of that person’s information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>Automated processing and profiling</p>
<div>
<p>In order to determine insurance limits and insurance premiums, insurance market participants benchmark client and beneficiary attributes and likelihood for insured events to occur and to understand fraud patterns. This requires that Gallagher and other insurance market participants may compile and analyse information in respect of all insureds, beneficiaries and claimants to model such likelihoods. We may use personal and commercial information in order to create the models and also to match against the models (profiling) to determine both the risk and the premium price for you and other insureds based on similar exposures and risks. We also use this information to help advise you about the typical levels of insurance coverage that your peers may have in place. This may necessitate the use of special categories of data and criminal records data (such as prior motoring convictions for motor insurance).</p>
<p>Where a decision is necessary in relation to your insurance policy sometimes we may make decisions using automated means. The automated process will consider the information that you provide us (for example, details of the property that you wish to insure), as well as other information such as eircode, information resulting from analytics, and local crime rate, to determine whether your application for insurance can be accepted and the associated premium. Where we make automated decisions about you using your personal information, you may request that the decision is verified to confirm that the automated decision has been made correctly as well as to ask that it be reviewed by an individual decision-maker.</p>
<p><a href="#top">▲ Back to Top</a></p>
</div>
<p>Your rights</p>
<div>
<p>Under data protection law you have the right to make certain requests in relation to the personal information that we hold about you. We will not usually make a charge for dealing with these requests. If you wish to exercise these rights at any time please contact us using the details set out in the “Contacting us” section.</p>
<p>There may be cases where we may not be able to comply with your request (such as where this would conflict with our obligation to comply with other regulatory and/ or legal requirements). However, if we can’t comply with your request, we will tell you the reason, and we will always respond to any request you make.</p>
<p>There may also be circumstances where exercising some of these rights (such as the right to erasure, the right to restriction of processing and the right to withdraw consent) will mean your insurance can no longer be provided and it may therefore result in cancellation of your policy. You will therefore lose the right to bring any claim or receive any benefit, including in relation to any event that occurred before you exercised your right of erasure, if our ability to handle the claim has been prejudiced. Your policy terms and conditions set out what will happen in the event your policy is cancelled.</p>
<p>Your rights include:</p>
<p>The right to access your personal information</p>
<p>You are entitled to a copy of the personal information we hold about you and certain details of how we use it.</p>
<p>We will usually provide you with your information in writing, unless you request otherwise, or where you have made the request using electronic means, in which case the information will, where possible, be provided to you by electronic means.</p>
<p>The right to rectification</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that information we hold about you is accurate and complete. However, you can ask us to amend or update it if you do not believe this is the case.</p>
<p>The right to erasure</p>
<p>You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances, for example where you withdraw your consent or where the personal information we collected is no longer necessary for the original purpose. This will need to be balanced against other factors however. For example, we may have regulatory and/ or legal obligations which mean we cannot comply with your request.</p>
<p>The right to restriction of processing</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, you are entitled to ask us to stop using your personal information, for example where you think that we no longer need to use your personal information or where you think that the personal information we hold about you may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>The right to data portability</p>
<p>You have the right, under certain circumstances, to ask that we transfer personal information that you have provided to us to another third party of your choice.</p>
<p>The right to object to processing, including marketing</p>
<p>You have the right to object to your personal information being processed where we rely on legitimate interest as a legal ground to process your personal information and we cannot demonstrate overriding compelling legitimate grounds of our own.</p>
<p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time. You can do this either by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link which is contained in any email that we send to you or you can use the details set out in the “Contacting us” section to contact us. If you opt out of receiving marketing messages, we may still send you service related communications where necessary including information related to the renewal of your policy.</p>
<p>Rights relating to automated decision-making</p>
<p>You can contact us using the details set out in the “Contacting us” section and ask us to review the decision if you have been subject to an automated decision using your personal information.</p>
<p>The right to withdraw consent</p>
<p>We will ask for your consent for certain uses of your personal information. Where we do this, you have the right to withdraw your consent to further use of your personal information.</p>
<p>The right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission</p>
<p>We would always encourage you to contact us if you have any concerns with how we use your personal information and we will do our best to resolve your concerns. Where you feel that we have not addressed your concerns appropriately please contact our data protection officer using the details in the Contacting Us section. However, you have a right to complain to the Data Protection Commission in Ireland if you believe that any use of your personal information by us is in breach of applicable data protection laws and/ or regulations. More information can be found on the the Data Protection Commission website: <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">https://www.dataprotection.ie/</a>.
