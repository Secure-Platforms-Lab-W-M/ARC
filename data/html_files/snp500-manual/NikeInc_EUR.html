<p><strong>WHY and HOW Do We Use Your Personal Data?</strong></p>
<p>We use your personal data in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>To Provide the Features of the Platform and Services You Request</strong></p>
<p>When you use our Platform, we will use your personal data to provide the requested product or service.&nbsp; For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion. If you contact our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question.</p>
<p>If you use our Platform to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this personal data and store it so that you can review it in the Platform.&nbsp; Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location data and movement data.&nbsp; We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the Platform.</p>
<p>In many cases, to use particular features within our Platform&nbsp;you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.&nbsp; For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Platform, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device.

<p><strong>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</strong></p>

<p><em>Direct Marketing</em></p>
<p>If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the contact details you provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted-out). In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information.</p>
<p><em>Personalization</em></p>
<p>We may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or services - such as your use of Nike’s Platform, your visits to or purchases made in Nike stores, your participation in Nike events and contests - to personalize communications on products and services that may be interesting for you. &nbsp;In doing so, we may combine the information you provide to us with information that we create about your online activity, including internal insights and analysis.

<p>If you sign-in to your Nike account using different devices, we may associate you across the different devices you use to browse our Platform. We may use information collected across these devices to personalize communications on our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</strong></p>

<p><strong>For General Research and Analysis Purposes</strong></p>

<p><strong>International&nbsp;Transfers of your Personal Data</strong></p>

Some of the data recipients with whom Nike shares your personal data may be located in countries other than the country in which your personal data originally was collected.

<p><strong>COOKIES and Pixel Tags</strong></p>
<p>Nike collects information, which may include personal data, from your browser when you use our Platform. We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information, which may include your (i) IP address; (ii) unique cookie identifier, cookie information and information on whether your device has software to access certain features; (iii) unique device identifier and device type; (iv) domain, browser type and language, (v) operating system and system settings; (vi) country and time zone; (vii) previously visited websites; (viii) information about your interaction with our Platform such as click behavior, purchases and indicated preferences; and (ix) access times and referring URLs.</p>
<p>Third parties may also collect information via Platform through cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets. These third parties collect data directly from your web browser and the processing of this data is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers’ usage of the Platform and to understand our customers’ preferences (such as country and language choices). This enables us to provide services to our customers and improve their online experience. We also use cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about Platform traffic and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Platform. There are generally three categories of cookies used on our Platform:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Functional:</strong>&nbsp;These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always enabled. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Platform within a single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping bag and checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong>&nbsp;These cookies allow us to improve our Platform’s functionality by tracking usage. In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember site preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored recommendations and slow site performance.</li>
<li><strong>Social media and Advertising</strong>: Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from our Platform through social media. Advertising cookies (of third parties) collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within and beyond our Platform. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data. Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.</li>
</ul><p>We interact with third-party analytics services on our Platform. These third parties share reports with us about the use of our Platform, including to help us better understand our Platform users’ interests and demographics. These reports do not contain information that directly identifies you. However, they can be used by these third parties for our remarketing campaigns to you if you have turned on certain ads personalization services. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent to conduct this activity.</p>
<p>You can always change your preference by visiting the "Cookie Settings" at the bottom of each page of our websites.</p>
<p>You may also see our ads on other websites, such as our partner’s websites, because we use third-party ad services. Through these ad services, we can show you ads that may be tailored to your individual interests. These ad services may also track your online activities over time and across multiple websites and apps by collecting information through automated means. This data collection takes place both on our Platform and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad services.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through Nike Platform or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose.&nbsp; You can also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features that make our Platform more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. There are also general resources for opting out of interest-based advertising available on the website of the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile device at the device level. &nbsp;For example, to adjust your advertising preferences in iOS, visit Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising &gt; Limit Ad Tracking. To adjust your advertising preferences in Android, visit Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of interest-based ads.</p>
<p><strong>USING Nike Platform with Third-Party Products and Services</strong></p>
<p>Our Platform allows you to interact with a wide variety of other digital products and services.&nbsp; For example, our Platform can integrate with third-party devices for activity tracking, social networks, music streaming services and other digital services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to connect your Nike account with a third-party device or account, your privacy rights on third-party platforms will be governed by their respective policies.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to share your Nike activity on third-party social media platforms, if you browse our website while being authenticated on third-party platforms and you turned on certain ads personalization services, or if you ask us to link your Nike account with your membership accounts with Nike’s Partners, the policies of those third-party platforms and Partners govern the data that resides there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Platform may provide links to other (third-party) websites and apps for your convenience or information. Linked sites and apps have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly encourage you to review. To the extent any linked websites or apps are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for their content, any use of the websites or apps, or the privacy practices of the websites or apps.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES to Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Applicable law and our practices change over time. If we decide to update our privacy policy, we will post the changes on our Platform. If we materially change the way in which we process your personal data, we will provide you with prior notice, or where legally required, request your consent prior to implementing such changes. We strongly encourage you to read our privacy policy and keep yourself informed of our practices. &nbsp;This privacy policy was last modified in November 2022.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS and Feedback</strong></p>
