<h2>RIGHTS REGARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents receive certain rights with respect to their personal information, as described below. These rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exceptions more fully set forth in the CCPA. California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment from us for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.</p>
<p><em>Right to know about personal information collected, disclosed, or sold</em></p>
<p>Each California resident has the right to request, subject to certain exceptions described in the CCPA, that we disclose to that resident:</p>
<ul>
<li>the categories of personal information we have collected about them,</li>
<li>the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected,</li>
<li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information,</li>
<li>the categories of third parties with whom we have shared the personal information, and</li>
<li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them (collectively, a "Request to Know").</li>
</ul>
<p>To make such a Request to Know, you can either call us at our toll free number (1-833-917-2099), or submit your request here in the <a title="Information Intake Request Form" href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/1b9d91ae632e4f45801aec8637920837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information Intake Request Form</a>.</p>
<p>In the past twelve months we have collected, and in the future we will continue to collect, the categories of personal information cited in the section entitled "INFORMATION COLLECTED" above from the sources described in that section.

<p><em>Process for verifying requests of California residents</em></p>
<p>In order to protect your privacy and security, prior to completing any Request to Know or Request to Delete that you may submit, we must verify your identity.

In certain instances, additional verification steps may be required.</p>
<p><em>Authorized agents</em></p>
<p>California residents have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on their behalf. Prior to completing a request made by such an authorized agent, we require that you provide your authorized agent with written permission to submit such a request and require that you or your authorized agent provide us with a copy of such written permission. Additionally, we require that you verify your identity pursuant to the procedure described above.</p>
