We will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must attach a copy of the following information to the request:</p>
<ol>
<li>A completed document proving that you have authorization to act on the consumer's behalf.</li>
<li>If you are a business, proof that you are registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do not receive both pieces of information, the request will be denied.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Information for a Business Purpose. </strong>California Civil Code Sections 1798.115(c), 1798.130(a)(5)(c), 1798.130(c), and 1798.140 indicate that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of information are collected,&nbsp;sold&nbsp;or transferred for an organization's&nbsp;business purpose&nbsp;(as those terms are defined under California law). While we do not sell personal information, we do transfer personal information for a business purpose. The table below indicates the categories of personal information we collect and transfer in a variety of contexts. Please note that because this list is comprehensive, it may refer to types of information that we collect and share about people other than yourself. For example, while we transfer credit card or debit card numbers for our business purpose in order to process payments for orders placed with us, we do not collect or transfer credit card or debit card numbers of individuals that submit questions through our website’s “contact us” page.</p>
