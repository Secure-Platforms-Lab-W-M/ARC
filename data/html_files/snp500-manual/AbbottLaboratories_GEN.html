				<span>How does Abbott define Personal Information?</span>
			</div>
			<div><p>“Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual or could be used to reasonably identify you.&nbsp; Examples of Personal Information include, but are not limited to, your name, address and contact information.</p>

<p>“Sensitive Personal Information” means Personal Information that reveals a consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in, financial account number, debit card number, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; precise geolocation; racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, or union membership; contents of email or text messages; and genetic data. Sensitive Personal Information also includes processing of biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer and Personal Information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation. Sensitive Personal Information also includes “sensitive data” as that term is defined in the applicable US State Privacy Law.</p>

			<div>
				<span>How does Abbott collect Personal Information?</span>
			</div>
			<div><p>Abbott collects Personal Information online and offline in a few different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Information that you provide</strong>. We may collect Personal Information and other information that you provide when you use our Services, attend Abbott programs or events, participate in a clinical trial, and any other data that you may choose to submit or provide.&nbsp; With your permission, we may also collect data from another source like a device or social media account.&nbsp; Such information may include, but not be limited to, contact information (such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, user ID and password), date of birth, professional credentials, experiences, activities, skills, preferences, hobbies and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information from public or third-party sources</strong>. We may collect data from public sources including, but not limited to, social media and other websites that enable social sharing. We may also collect Personal Information from government agencies, public or third-party information sources, third-party service providers, or business partners.&nbsp; In addition, we also may collect information from industry and patient groups and associations or combine information we have collected from multiple sources.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information collected from devices you use to connect with us or use our Services.&nbsp; </strong>Abbott collects data through<strong> </strong>our websites and apps and automatically from devices you use to connect to our Services.&nbsp; For more information about this, please see our "Cookies and Other Tools” section below.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information collected when you make a purchase</strong>.&nbsp; When you make a purchase on our website, we will collect Personal Information to process, fulfill, and ship your order.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information collected with business partners</strong>.&nbsp; We sometimes work with other organizations to provide you with our Services.&nbsp; When that happens, we require that information be protected.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to submit any Personal Information relating to other people, you represent that you have the authority to do so and permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
</p>

<p>Abbott hopes to deliver to you advertising for products and Services you need or want.&nbsp; Abbott, its serviced providers and partners, use common tracking tools, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies, to automatically collect Personal Information about users for purposes of enhancing their online experience and delivering more meaningful advertisements. &nbsp;Like many companies, Abbott may also utilize third-party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.&nbsp; Certain laws define this as “cross-context behavioral advertising”.</p>

<p>Like many companies, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom we work to place their own Tools when an individual visits Abbott websites and apps. &nbsp;This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited Abbott websites and apps and to serve you ads based on your web browsing activity, purchases, interests and/or other information—a practice commonly referred to as interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These advertising companies may also use these types of technologies to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and serve you ads on websites you visit and applications you use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Retargeting</strong>.&nbsp; One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as “retargeting” or “remarketing.” Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on an individual’s online activities on a different, unrelated site. For example, if you look at an Abbott product on an Abbott website, you may later see an advertisement for that Abbott&nbsp;product when you visit third-party sites. &nbsp;To do this, Abbott or its advertising service providers may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon or similar technology placed by Abbott or our service provider when you visit Abbott websites or apps or third-party websites or apps.&nbsp; The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites. You should consult the privacy policies of our service providers and other websites that you visit to understand how they collect and use your data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Opting-Out of IBA, OBA and Retargeting Activities</strong></p>


<p>As a participant of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), we adhere to DAA’s Interest-Based Advertising principles by providing you enhanced notice, transparency and control of our digital marketing practices as stated at http://www.aboutads.info/principles/. &nbsp;Click&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">here</a>&nbsp;to opt-out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes and receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from our advertising partners. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. &nbsp;Also, certain versions of the iOS operating system permit you to “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">Limit Ad Tracking</a>” in the system settings, and certain versions of the Android operating system allow you to “<a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">Opt-out of Interest-Based Ads</a>” in the system settings. &nbsp;Options you select are browser and device specific.</p>

<p><strong>Abbott Do Not Track Policy.</strong>&nbsp;Some browsers have Do Not Track (“DNT”) features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform, and some browsers may not be set up to honor such requests. &nbsp;Abbott honors the AdChoice DNT signals. &nbsp;Options you select are browser and device specific. Please be aware that limiting the ability of websites to set cookies, however, may worsen your overall user experience, and in some cases the sites will not work properly without cookies, local storage and similar technologies.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transfer of Personal information Between Countries</strong></p>

<p><br>
Any Personal Information you provide to Abbott may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States, where Abbott is headquartered, and other countries which may not guarantee the same level of protection of Personal Information as the one in which you reside. &nbsp;However, Abbott will handle your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy regardless of where your Personal Information is stored/accessed.</p>

<p>We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability.</p>
<p>To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact the website’s owner please use the website's form</p>
<strong>Screen-reader and keyboard navigation</strong>
<p>Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Screen-reader optimization:&nbsp;</strong>we run a process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images. It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.<br><br>These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Keyboard navigation optimization:&nbsp;</strong>The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.<br><br>Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside.<br><br>Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.</li>

<strong>Assistive technology and browser compatibility</strong>
<p>We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users.</p>
<strong>Notes, comments, and feedback</strong>
<p>Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements. If you wish to contact the website’s owner, please use the website's form</p></div> </div> </div>
