    <p><b>AIG INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA</b></p>
<p><b>PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</b></p>
<p>AIG and Individual Privacy</p>
<p>We at AIG Insurance Company of Canada (referred to as “AIG”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) abide by these Privacy Principles and want you, our applicants, policyholders, insureds, claimants, and any other individuals who provide us with personal information (referred to as “Customers” or “you”), to be aware of how and why we handle personal information. We work hard to respect and maintain your privacy. However, the very nature of our business is such that the collection, use and disclosure of personal information are fundamental to the products and services we provide.</p>
<p>As a worldwide leader in the delivery of insurance products and other services, the member companies of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG Companies”) offer numerous products and services to many types of consumers and clients in many different countries around the world. Therefore, differing AIG Companies may adopt differing privacy practices to fit their own jurisdiction and business requirements. The AIG Companies Privacy Policy, located at <a href="http://www.aig.com">www.aig.com</a>, may also be applicable to our Customers as we conduct our business.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these Privacy Principles personal information means information about an identified or identifiable individual. For example: an individual’s name, birth date, address, age, health and financial information is personal information which AIG may collect, use and in certain circumstances, where necessary, disclose, in the course of providing insurance services and carrying on business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent and Personal Information</b></p>
<p>AIG obtains consent for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, except where consent is not required by law. AIG does not obtain your consent for the collection, use and disclosure of business contact information. By applying for or purchasing AIG’s products and services, you are providing your consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as set out in these Privacy Principles. AIG relies on the broker’s advice where the insurance broker tells AIG that we have a Customer’s consent to collect information.</p>
<p>Consent may be obtained by AIG and its affiliated companies directly or through a broker or agent, an insurance adjuster, claims administrator, investigator, or lawyer when personal information is collected for claims purposes.</p>
<p>An individual may decline to consent, or revoke consent, to the collection and use of personal information for insurance purposes but in that case, insurance products and related services and the assessment of applications, claims or complaints may be limited or terminated.</p>
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We may collect information directly from the individual concerned on applications for insurance and through direct interactions with us, including via AIG websites, software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”), our social media pages set forth in the links in the footer on AIG.com and other means (for example, from your application and claim forms, telephone calls, emails and other communications with us, as well as from claim investigators, medical professionals, witnesses or other third parties involved in our business dealings with you). We also collect information from various third-party sources such as: insurance brokers, adjusters, other insurance intermediaries, third party administrators, government, industry associations, and other entities that have information about you. For instance, we may obtain your driving record, claims history and/or credit history, where permitted by law, to assist us in underwriting your application for insurance. We and our service providers may supplement the personal information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our affiliates or business partners. This information from third parties is subject to the privacy policies under which the information was collected..</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Personal information is typically collected and used by us for insurance purposes such as: assessing risk, processing applications for insurance coverage, establishing rates, administering insurance products, developing and improving insurance products and services and other services, including actuarial and pricing tools and risk engineering, risk management and loss prevention programs for our insurance clients, claim assessment, processing and settlement, and, where applicable, managing claim disputes. AIG also uses personal information to detect and prevent fraud, to detect, prevent, and respond to actual or suspected information security events, compile statistics, verify and provide information to insurance industry associations, report to regulatory or industry entities in accordance with laws and prudent insurance industry practices, and conduct market research. This may also include collecting and disclosing personal information about third parties with respect to claims made against AIG Customers. We may collect and use personal information for other purposes, in which case, we will notify you of such other purposes prior to the collection and use of the personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Personal information for Marketing Purposes</b></p>
<p>AIG may collect and use personal information for marketing purposes, such as identifying and communicating with individuals who are most likely to find AIG products and services of interest. AIG may also disclose personal information to our affiliates to use for marketing purposes to offer you their products and services, which may be of interest to you. You may opt not to have us, or alternatively not to have our affiliates, collect, use or disclose personal information for marketing purposes in which case we and our affiliates will not use or disclose personal information for marketing purposes. Offers of upgraded or additional coverage, special offers and promotional mailings, and offers of additional products and services from our affiliates will not be sent by us or our affiliates. As an AIG customer, if you have not opted out of receiving marketing communications, you may receive marketing emails regarding AIG products and services. Each marketing email will include an unsubscribe mechanism, available for you at any time to remove your consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy of Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>AIG maintains policies and procedures to ensure that the information we collect and use is accurate, up-todate, and as complete as possible. However, we rely on individuals to disclose all material information to us and to inform us of any changes required. A request to access or correct your personal information in our possession may be made by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address set out below in the section titled “Contacting the Privacy Officer,” and by providing valid proof of your identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguarding Your Information</b></p>
<p>We apply appropriate safeguards to our computer networks and physical files, and we restrict access to personal information to those AIG employees and non-employee workers, to independent third-party service providers or technology service providers (“Authorized Administrator”) reinsurers, consultants or insurance representatives who need to know that information in order to underwrite, adjudicate or administer insurance products and services.</p>
<p><b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>Personal information is disclosed by usto both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies, reinsurers, insurance and reinsurance brokers and other intermediaries and agents, appointed representatives, distributors, financial institutions and insurance industry organizations at the time of assessing an application for insurance and any renewal, extension, variation or cancellation of any issued policy, as well as in the event of any claim, to the extent necessary for statistical purposes or to assess and rate a specific risk, determine the status of coverage, and to investigate, administer and provide updates regarding claims. We also share information to investigate allegations of combat fraud; to detect, prevent, and respond to actual and suspected information security incidents; where permitted or required by law; to protect and defend legal claims; and, at the request of government institutions in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>AIG sometimes retains an affiliated company, a reinsurer, or an Authorized Administrator to perform on our behalf certain functions in support of the products and services we provide. Such functions could include the underwriting, offering or administering of AIG insurance products and services or any related claims. Accordingly, in certain instances these affiliates or third parties require your personal information to the extent that it is necessary in the performance of those specific reinsurance, underwriting, marketing, consulting, administrative, analytical, rehabilitative, claims, investigation, reporting or related services. AIG obligates these affiliates and third parties to use and take steps to protect personal information in accordance with the requirements of these <i>Privacy Principles</i>.</p>
<p>Some AIG affiliates and Authorized Administrators may be located outside of Canada, in the United States of America or another foreign jurisdiction outside of Canada. When this occurs, the collection, use and disclosure of personal information will be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is situated. By communicating personal information to us, applying for and/or acquiring the products and services of AIG, you hereby consent to the AIG affiliates or Authorized Administrators located outside of Canada accessing, processing or storing your personal information (as the case may be) and disclosing such personal information as required by the governing laws of that jurisdiction. If you would like to obtain more information about our use of Authorized Administrators or any other service providers located outside of Canada, please contact the Privacy Officer at the address set out below in the section titled <i>“Contacting the Privacy Officer”.</i></p>
<p>AIG may transfer your personal information as an asset in connection with any contemplated or actual sale, merger or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets, or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed with such a transaction or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to such parties. In such circumstances, we will ensure that any transfer of personal information is handled by us in accordance with applicable law using appropriate data protection and security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention and Access to Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We retain personal information for the purposes described in these <i>Privacy Principles</i> but only for so long as is necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which the personal information was collected and as required by law. Personal information is stored at one of our offices in Canada, or at a location of one of our affiliates or Authorized Administrators in the United States or another foreign country, as defined under <i>“Disclosure of Personal Information”</i> above. Access to your personal information is limited to our employees and nonemployee workers, agents, insurance intermediaries, reinsurers, and Authorized Administrators who need access in order to perform their job or provide services.</p>
<p>A request to access information in our possession may be made by contacting the Privacy Officer at the address set out below in the section titled<i> “Contacting the Privacy Officer”.</i> The right to access information is not absolute. Therefore, AIG may decline access to personal information about you that we have under our control, subject to any legal restrictions. Such instances of refusal may, include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information is subject to solicitor/client privilege;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the information would reveal personal information about a third party;</li>
<li>the information could compromise the investigation of a claim; or&nbsp;</li>
<li>the information is confidential commercial information.</li>
