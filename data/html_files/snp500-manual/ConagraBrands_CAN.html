<p>Last Updated: September 30, 2021</p>

<p>Conagra Foods Canada Inc. (“Conagra Brands Canada”, “we”, “us” or “our”) recognizes that those who visit our websites or otherwise interact with us online or offline are concerned about how personal information they provide is maintained and used by Conagra Brands Canada. This policy describes our information practices and the choices that you can make about the collection, use and disclosure of your information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information about our employees or applicants for employment.</p>

<h2>We may share information with third parties.</h2>

<p><strong>We will share information within the Conagra Brands family of companies.</strong> This also includes future subsidiaries or affiliates. We share information within the Conagra Brands family of companies when such companies provide services on our behalf or where the sharing is otherwise necessary to provide a product or service that you have requested. With your consent, we also share personal information within the Conagra Brands family of companies for marketing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.</strong> We share information with vendors who send emails for us, and with companies that operate our websites or administer activities on our behalf, such as promotion administration.

<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the sites. Google Analytics provides information about how many users visit our sites, when they may visit, and how they navigate the sites once they are on them. We may also use other Google Analytics tools, such as Demographics and Interest Reporting, which enables us to learn more about the characteristics and interests of the users who visit our sites. For information about how Google uses the information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.

<p><strong>We may share information with promotional partners.</strong> From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Conagra Brands Canada for joint promotions.

We will not share information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless we first get your consent to such sharing.</p>

This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion. Our service providers may also share information as required by the laws applicable to them.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information that is posted on public forums or reviews.</strong> Any information, such as reviews, that you may disclose on our sites, in blogs, on message boards, or on other public areas on our sites, becomes public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. Conagra Brands Canada cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy and safety, and is not responsible for the results of such postings.</p>

<p><strong>We may share aggregate and anonymous data.</strong> We may share information that is not reasonably identified with you for any purpose.

<p><strong>We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you at the point of collection or prior to such sharing.</strong></p>

<h2><a name="choices">You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.</a></h2>

<h2>You have certain rights with respect to your personal information.</h2>

<h2>These sites and children.</h2>

<p>Our sites are generally meant for adults. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 on our sites without permission from a parent or guardian.</p>

<h2>We use standard security measures.</h2>

<p>The file containing your personal information is maintained on our servers or those of our service providers and is accessible by authorized employees, representatives and agents who require access for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We use standard security measures to protect the personal information in our control. However, no security measures can offer absolute security. Therefore, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<p>The Internet in particular is not secure. We cannot promise that your use of our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords.</p>

<p>We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.</p>

<h2>Personal information may be processed outside Canada.</h2>

<p>Your personal information may be processed by Conagra Brands Canada or our service providers (including other Conagra Brands group companies) outside of Canada, including in the United States. While outside of Canada, personal information will be subject to applicable foreign laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in Canada. For more information about Conagra Brands Canada’s policies and practices related to the transfer of processing of personal information outside of Canada, please contact us as described below.</p>

<h2>We may link to other sites we don't control.</h2>

<p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to a website we do not control. This includes social media sites. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third party practices.</p>
