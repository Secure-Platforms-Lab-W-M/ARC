Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements, and some&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;considered to provide adequate protection&nbsp;to&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;originating from your home country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We comply with laws governing the international transfer of Personal Data,&nbsp;typically through the execution of legally required data protection agreements incorporating, where applicable, standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or other instructions or measures that may be specified, updated, amended, replaced or superseded from time to time by the applicable regulatory authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under certain data protection laws and regulations, there may be additional requirements with which we must comply before transferring any Personal Data outside of the territory from which it has been collected, including without&nbsp;limitation, having obtained explicit consent from you and having undertaken certain security assessments mandated by local laws and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In light of the above,&nbsp;your&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Data&nbsp;may&nbsp;be accessible to law enforcement and/or regulatory authorities in accordance with the applicable laws in the relevant jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If&nbsp;you are outside the EEA or the UK</strong>,&nbsp;by submitting your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;or engaging with our Website, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you consent to&nbsp;the&nbsp;transfer, storing or processing&nbsp;of your Personal Data as described in this Notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Data Security and Retention&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Security of Your Personal Data&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take what we determine to be reasonable physical, technical and administrative security standards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your&nbsp;Personal Data. We store information we receive about you in computer systems and databases operated either by us or our external service providers.&nbsp;We take steps to limit access controls and add encryption and anti-malware protections to your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;as appropriate. We will collect and store&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;on your device using application data caches and browser cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also have an important role to play in protecting the security of your&nbsp;Personal Data, and you should take care about disclosing information, and how you protect your communications and devices. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Website or applications, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with&nbsp;anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retention of&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apply a general rule of keeping&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;only for as long as&nbsp;reasonably necessary&nbsp;to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purpose of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.&nbsp; We typically retain certain elements of your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;for a period of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, for example to maintain an accurate record of your dealings with us, such as pursuant to a&nbsp;contract so that we can raise or defend a legal claim. In some circumstances we may retain&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;for other periods of time, for instance where we are required&nbsp;or permitted&nbsp;to do so in accordance with legal requirements, or&nbsp;if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required.&nbsp;We may also retain your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of&nbsp;litigation in respect to our relationship with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we will anonymize your&nbsp;Personal Data&nbsp;(so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may&nbsp;retain&nbsp;this information indefinitely without further notice to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where required by law we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify&nbsp;your Personal Data&nbsp;when it is no longer needed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;purposes&nbsp;for&nbsp;which it was collected and/or the purposes for which you provided consent.&nbsp;</p>
