<p>Some Verizon wireless devices include system apps we provide to:</p>

<ul><li>collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and apps on the device.</li>
	<li>automatically install apps when you activate your device, during certain operating system upgrades and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone. The software collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may update or send you information about Verizon and third-party offers and promotions that may interest you as well as notices about apps on your device that you have not yet used. You can use your device app controls to disable notifications from Verizon App Manager to opt out of these messages.</li>
</ul><p>Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p></div>

The Maine law gives you the right to control certain ways that we use or share information we have about you and requires that we provide you with a notice of your rights and our obligations under this law.

<p>The Maine law also requires us to take reasonable measures to protect <a aria-expanded="false" data-te-target="YQ7gRWmvAXuc2xiormV7" href="#">customer personal information<sup> 48</sup></a>.

<p>We will not use, disclose, sell, or permit access to your Maine broadband customer personal information except for <a aria-expanded="false" data-te-target="EwPJPAo9HP6AJa9vjKdW" href="#">purposes allowed under the Maine law<sup> 49</sup></a> or with your affirmative consent.
