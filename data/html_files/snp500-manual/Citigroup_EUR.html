															<h2>Personal Information Collected Through the Services</h2>
															<p>We collect two types of information: Personal Information and Other Information. </p>
															<p>"Personal Information" is sometimes also referred to as personal data, personally identifiable information or other like terms to mean any information that directly or indirectly identifies you or is reasonably capable of being associated with you or your household. </p>

This includes Personal Information that you provide to us and Personal Information that we collect automatically when you visit or interact with the Services.</p>
															
															<p><b>Information That You Provide to Us</b></p>

															<h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
															<p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile apps. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.
