<h3>Retention</h3>
<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. This includes providing you with a service you have requested from us or to comply with applicable legal requirements. It also includes keeping your personal information for so long as there is any possibility that you or we may wish to bring a legal claim, or where we are required to keep your personal information for legal or regulatory reasons.  If you wish to receive further information regarding our record retention procedures, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How Can I Contact Aon?” section below.</p>

<p>We may also retain your personal information where such retention is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>


<h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>

<p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below, and prohibits us from discriminating against individuals for exercising their privacy rights under the law. If you are a California resident, this section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>

<p><strong>Verifiable Requests to Delete, Correct and to Know. </strong>Subject to certain exceptions, consumers have the right to make the following requests, at no charge:</p>

<h3><em>Request to Know</em></h3>

<p>California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about them in the prior 12 months and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance. California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information in the prior 12 months, including the:</p>

<ul>
	<li>categories of personal information collected;</li>
<li>categories of sources of personal information;</li>
<li>business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;</li>
<li>categories of third parties/with whom we have disclosed or shared their personal information;</li>
<li>categories of personal information that we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose;</li>
<li>categories of personal information collected; and</li>
<li>categories of third parties to whom the residents’ personal information has been sold and the specific categories of personal information sold to each category of third party.
</li>
</ul>

<p>California residents may make Requests to Know up to twice every 12 months.</p>

<h3><em>Deletion Request Rights</em></h3>

<p>You have the right to request that Aon delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions as set out by law. Once we receive and verify your consumer request (see  <span><a href="#submitting">Submitting a Verifiable Request</a></span> ), we will delete your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

<h3><em>Correction Rights </em></h3>
<p>You have the right to request us to correct your personal information where it is inaccurate or out of date. Once we receive and verify your consumer request (see <span><a href="#submitting">Submitting a Verifiable Request</a></span> ), we will endeavor to correct your personal information from our records.</p>


<h3><em>Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of your Personal Information</em></h3>

<p>You have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out" of sales). The CCPA defines a “sale” as disclosing or making available to a third party personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we do disclose or make available personal information to third parties in order to receive certain services or benefits from them. Opt-out rights can be exercised by going to our <a href="https://www.aon.com/about-aon/cookies.jsp" target="_blank">Cookie Notice</a> . We do not sell personal information about California residents who we know are younger than 16 years old without opt-in consent. The personal Information disclosed may fall into the following category: Identifiers and Internet and other Similar Network Activity.</p>

<p>You also have the right to opt-out of information Aon shares for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. To exercise the right to opt-out of “Selling” or “Sharing”, you may indicate your cookie preferences by visiting the following Internet Web page link: <span><a href="https://www.aon.com/about-aon/cookies.jsp" target="_blank">"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information"</a></span> or you may configure your browser to send the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal, which will transmit your opt-out request to Aon automatically. </p>

<p>To turn on the GPC signal, you can download one of the supported browsers or extensions. You may visit <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download" target="_blank">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download</a> for a list of the available browsers or extensions.  
</p>

<h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>

<p>We will not discriminate against you and will not restrict or deny you access to our services because of choices and requests you make in connection with your personal information. Please note, certain choices may affect our ability to deliver our Services. For example, if you sign up to receive marketing communications by email, then ask us to delete all of your information, we will be unable to send you marketing communications. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em>Submitting a Verifiable Request</em></h3>

<p>To submit a verifiable Delete, Copy or Right to Know request, please email us at privacy@aon.com, or call +1.877.384.4276 (toll free).</p>

<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. If you are an authorized agent making a request, we may require and request additional information to protect the personal information entrusted to us, including information to verify that you are authorized to make that request.</p>

<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
	<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  We may also be unable to comply with your request if we have a legal or regulatory obligation to keep your personal information, such as when the information is necessary to complete a transaction.  Other reasons your request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical to honor.  </p>

<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>

<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>

<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h3>

<p>Aon reserves the right to amend this Notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this Notice, we will post the updated Notice on the Website and update the Notice's effective date. If the changes materially affect you, we will attempt to notify you in advance of such change, such as via a notice on our Site and via email to the email address we have on file for you. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about this Notice, the ways in which Aon collects and uses your personal information, your choices and rights regarding such use, or wish to exercise your rights under California law, please do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>
