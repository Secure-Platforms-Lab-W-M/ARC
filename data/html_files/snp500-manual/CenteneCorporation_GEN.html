<p>Last Updated: April 17, 2020</p>

<p>At Centene Corporation ("Centene"), we are aware of your privacy interests and concerns. This privacy policy is intended to explain the types of information Centene may obtain about visitors to our website at www.centene.com (the "Site") and how the information is used.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We collect a limited amount of personal information from you in certain areas of the Site for various reasons. The following is a description of what information is collected:</p>

<p><em>Registration Information.&nbsp;</em>There may be third party features of the Site, which could require a separate registration. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third party features before providing personally identifiable information. Centene is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>


<p><em>IP Addresses.</em> An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, web servers may be able to identify the type of browser and/or type of computer you are using. Centene collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration, to assess the traffic to the Site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to maintain and improve the Site. We do not link IP addresses to your personally identifiable information. We can and will use IP addresses, however, to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our <a href="/terms-conditions.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> or to protect our service, the Site, customers or others.</p>

<p><em>Use of Cookies.</em> Cookies are small bits of information that some web sites (including the Site) transfer to an individual's hard drive for research purposes. Such information includes your IP address, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, location information, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Site you visit, number of links you click while on the Site, search terms, keyword searches, and/or other data concerning your use of the Site. This information is automatically generated and may be combined with personal information about you. Centene uses cookies for the following purposes:</p>

<p><em>Authentication:&nbsp;</em>We use cookies to identify you when you visit and navigate the Site.</p>

<p><em>Status:&nbsp;</em>We use cookies to help us to determine if you are logged into the Site.</p>

<p><em>Analysis:&nbsp;</em>We use Google Analytics to collect and analyze information about use of our Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn about Google's practices by visiting www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p>

<p><em>Cookie Consent:&nbsp;</em>We use cookies to store your preferences in relation to the use of cookies more generally.</p>

<p>The use of cookies has become a standard in the industry. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some of the functionality of the Site. The Site's partners may also use cookies in connection with the services and web sites to which the Site links. We do not control these cookies.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. WHO COLLECTS THIS INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Centene collects the information described above via the Site. In the case of third party features such as advertising, co-branded areas, or links to other web sites, such third parties may also collect information. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third parties before providing personally identifiable information. Centene is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED</strong></p>

<p>Generally, Centene uses registration information to learn more about how visitors use the Site and to measure areas of interest. This allows Centene to build features and functionality that will enhance your Site experience. We might also use this information to provide customer support, enforce our Site Terms and Conditions, or other similar matters. Aggregate information is also used to help us run and maintain the Site, study traffic patterns, and generally learn about the usage of the Site.</p>

<p><em>Unrelated Companies.</em> Centene occasionally shares limited customer information with companies we hire to provide operational, marketing, or advertising support. The companies we choose must satisfy our security and privacy requirements. We share your information with these companies only if they agree to treat it confidentially and only if it is legally permissible to do so. We limit the information we provide these companies to what we reasonably believe they "need to know" in connection with their agreement with Centene, and we don't permit them to use our customer information for any purposes outside our oversight or control.</p>

<p><em>Government Authorities and Litigation.</em> Sometimes a law, court order, or other judicial or administrative process requires us to provide information to a government authority or party to a private lawsuit. We will provide the information that we believe, in good faith, is required to comply with the law, order, or other process.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. HOW INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong></p>
