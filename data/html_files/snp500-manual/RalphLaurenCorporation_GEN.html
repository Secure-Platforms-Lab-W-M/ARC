<h3><span>How can I track my package?</span></h3>
<p>When your order ships, you will receive a confirmation email containing tracking information.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Do you ship with Eco-Friendly packaging?</h3>
<p>Ralph Lauren is proud to offer Eco-Friendly packaging, designed to minimize waste. By selecting this packaging option, your order will arrive without:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Plastic or paper inserts</span></li>
<li><span>Hangers or garment bags</span></li>
<li><span>Ralph Lauren promotional materials</span></li>
<li><span>Paper invoices, return forms, or labels</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, fragile or special items may have additional packaging to ensure quality.</p>
<p>To receive Eco-Friendly packaging, select the check box <strong>“I would like to receive eco-friendly packaging with this order”</strong> while on the Shipping page in the order checkout process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Do you ship outside the United States?</h3>
<p>We ship to more than 20 countries outside the US. For a complete list, click on the country selector next to the store locator at the top of any RalphLauren.com page.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are Ralph Lauren stores all over the world. Use our <strong><a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/stores">store locator</a></strong> to find the one nearest you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>By which carrier will my order be shipped?</h3>
<p>We use different carriers to get customers their orders as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once your order has shipped, you will receive an email with the name of the carrier and any tracking information.</p>
<p>Orders sent by 2-Business Day or Next Day shipping methods are delivered Monday through Friday from 8 AM through 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Orders placed with Saturday delivery will arrive Saturday if placed between 3:01 PM ET Thursday and 3 PM ET Friday. If an order is placed after these hours, it will be shipped via Next Day shipping, and will arrive on the next business day.</p>
<p><em>Please note: Orders greater than 30 units are not eligible for expedited shipping (2-Business Day, Next Day, or Saturday delivery).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>How can I ship to multiple addresses?</span></h3>
<p>Select “ship to multiple locations” during checkout. Then, choose the appropriate address from the drop down list, if applicable, or enter an address by clicking “add new.” You’ll then select a shipping method for each address. Please note that shipping fees are applied for each address based on the method chosen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>When shipping to multiple addresses, why is shipping being charged even though I met the threshold for free shipping?&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Shipping fees are applied for each address based on the method chosen. Meeting the threshold for an individual shipment will remove the fee from that portion of the order only. To avoid all shipping fees, the threshold must be met for each shipment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>How long is the order processing time?</span></h3>
<p>Order processing times vary based on the shipping method. For information, click <strong><a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/customerservice?cid=cs-shipping-handling">Shipping &amp; Handling</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>How long does it take for a personalized item to be delivered?</span></h3>
<p>Personalized items are processed within 3-4 business days. Once shipped, the delivery date is dependent upon the shipping method chosen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>Does the invoice include the prices if I ship the item as a gift?</span></h3>
<p>No. Selecting gift packaging or gift messaging removes the prices from the invoice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How will the family I am shipping gifts to know which gift is for each person?</h3>
<p>On the bottom of each gift wrapped box is a small sticker that contains a number corresponding to each item on your packing invoice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>I entered my email address incorrectly on my order, how can I get a status on my package?</span></h3>
<p>Contact Customer Assistance via phone, email, or chat, and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

misrepresentation, or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; (2) claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising; (3) claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of bodily injury; (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (5) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have a Dispute heard in small claims
court, which shall seek only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and
is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This election may be made at any
time prior to the appointment of an arbitrator. Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
patents, or other intellectual property rights. In addition, each party retains the right to
bring issues to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies.</p>
<p>This agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration
Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16, and federal arbitration law apply and govern the
interpretation and enforcement of the dispute resolution provisions in these Terms of Use.
The dispute resolution provisions shall survive termination of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p><p>
</p><h3>Commencing DIsputes</h3>
<p>Prior to commencing an arbitration proceeding, you must first send a describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808, with a copy sent by email to RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com Notice”). The Notice must include your name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information for Ralph Lauren to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) your Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of your claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. You must personally sign the letter. You and Ralph Lauren agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference should Ralph Lauren request one. You must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if for some reason it is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you may commence an arbitration. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully complete Notice and participating in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any arbitration unless the claimant has complied with the Notice and informal dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>Arbitrations shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) as modified by the version of this
arbitration provision that is in effect when a party commences an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the AAA by visiting its website or calling its toll-free number. You may deliver any required or desired notice to Ralph Lauren by mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808, with a copy sent by email to
RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com. If there is a conflict between these dispute resolution provisions and the AAA Rules, these dispute resolution provisions shall govern. If AAA will not administer a proceeding under these dispute resolution provisions as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under these dispute resolution provisions as written.</p>
<p>Payment of filing and other fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of a claim, counterclaim, or relief sought in connection with the arbitration was frivolous or was brought for harassment or an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), either party will have the right to recover its arbitration fees and expenses. In addressing its determination, the arbitrator may consider, among other things, whether a party previously offered full relief to the other party, including, but not limited to, a full refund of the sum paid for items purchased. In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>Each of us may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each of us will bear our own attorneys’ fees, except in the following circumstances. If applicable law permits a prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party may seek fees as applicable law permits.</p>
<h3>The Arbitration</h3>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by one neutral arbitrator selected with the participation and involvement of both parties pursuant to the AAARules.
</p><p>if your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may elect that the dispute be resolved without an oral hearing, unless the arbitrator requests otherwise. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if requested by Ralph Lauren, you agree to personally appear (along with your counsel if you are represented) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed. Any in-person shall take place in the location of your county of residence</p>
<p>The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement as a court would be. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except for specific issues otherwise provided elsewhere in these dispute resolution provisions and issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration, which shall be for the court to decide. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the Parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals.</p>
<h3>Class Action Waiver; No Consolidation of Arbitral Claims</h3>
<p>The parties agree that the arbitrator may award the same damages and relief (including declaratory or injunctive relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the proceeding or order Ralph Lauren to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Ralph Lauren explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE LITIGATED OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS CLAIMS AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND RALPH LAUREN OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
</p><p>This class action and collective relief waiver is an essential part of this arbitration agreement and, if it is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief, neither you nor Ralph Lauren is entitled to arbitration of such claim or request for relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation is found to be unenforceable as to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.</p>
<h3>Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration</h3>
<p>If 25 or more individuals submit Notices or attempt to initiate arbitrations with Ralph Lauren raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or coordinated for these individuals (“Mass Claims”), you and Ralph Lauren agree that if the claims are not resolved and proceed to arbitration, they shall proceed in staged bellwether proceedings. You understand and agree that if you choose to initiate your claim as part of Mass Claims, the adjudication of your claim might be delayed. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Ralph Lauren shall each select ten cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate arbitrator. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept or administer arbitrations commenced in violation of these procedures. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage bellwether proceeding, each side may select another ten cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a second bellwether proceeding to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate arbitrator. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the Mass Claims, either through settlement or arbitration. If these mass arbitration procedures apply to a claimant’s Notice, any statute of limitations applicable to the claims set forth in that Notice will be tolled from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether proceeding until the claimant’s Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce these mass arbitration procedures and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, if Ralph Lauren makes any future changes to these dispute resolution provisions of these Terms of Use (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change by email to RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com. This is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of these dispute resolution provisions.</p>
<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial to the fullest extent permitted by law and we each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York County, New York.</p>

To that end, we require all Suppliers to observe certain operational standards set forth herein (“Standards”) for a safe, sustainable, inclusive, and ethical workplace that embraces a fundamental effort toward continuous improvement.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<br>
<b>Anti-Bribery/Conflict of Interest&nbsp;</b>– Suppliers must not engage in offering or accepting compensation of any value (such as gifts, discounts, services, loans, payments), either directly or indirectly, to or from any of the Company’s employees, service providers or to any government or political officials, to obtain an unfair or improper advantage. Suppliers shall also avoid any form of fraud or any action that creates, or appears to create, a conflict of interest with the Company.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulations (“IASR”) under the AODA require that Ralph Lauren Canada LP (“Ralph Lauren”) establish, implement, maintain and document its accessibility policies and multi-year accessibility plan (the “Accessibility Plan”), which outlines Ralph Lauren’ strategy for preventing and removing barriers for persons with disabilities and to meet our requirements under the IASR and the AODA.&nbsp;<br>
The Accessibility Policy and Multi-Year Accessibility Plan will be publicly available, including in an accessible format upon request.&nbsp; The Accessibility Plan will be reviewed and updated, if applicable, at least once every five years.</p>

<h3>Text Message Program Terms and Conditions</h3>

<div data-id="cs-text-message-program-tc" aria-hidden="true">
<title>Text Message Program Terms and Conditions</title>
<div>
<p>By signing up for the Ralph Lauren and/or Polo Factory Stores (collectively, “Ralph Lauren”, “us” “we”, “our”) Text Message Program (the “Program”), you agree to these terms and conditions (“Program Terms”) and our general <a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/customerservice?cid=cs-company-info-use-terms" title="Terms of Use"><u>Terms of Use</u></a> (which include mandatory arbitration of disputes, waiver of class action rights, limitations on your rights and remedies, and limitations on our liability). You further consent to our privacy practices as described in our <a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/customerservice?cid=cs-privacy-notice" title="Privacy Notice"><u>Privacy Notice</u></a>.</p>
<p>You authorize Ralph Lauren to send, to the mobile phone number you used to opt in via short code or that you otherwise provided to us, promotional and other text messages, including messages sent using an autodialer. Your consent to receive auto-dialed text messages shall not be interpreted to suggest or imply that any or all Program messages are sent using an autodialer/automatic telephone dialing system.</p>
<p>You understand that <strong>message and data rates may apply</strong> and your carrier may charge you or deduct usage credit from your account when you text us or we text you. Ralph Lauren will not be liable for any delays or failures in your receipt of any mobile messages connected with the Program. Delivery of mobile messages is subject to effective transmission from your carrier.</p>
<p>No purchase is necessary to participate in the Program, and you are not required to accept these Program Terms as a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services. If you do agree to the Program Terms, you consent to receiving recurring promotional Program texts each month, plus additional non-promotional texts. Ralph Lauren reserves the right to alter Program message frequency.</p>
<p>If at any time, you intend to stop using the mobile telephone number that you provided to sign up for the Program, including by canceling your service plan or selling or transferring the phone number to another party, you agree that you will opt out of the Program prior to ending your use of the mobile telephone number.
</p><p>You can unsubscribe from the Program by texting “STOP” to the Program short code or as a reply to a Program message you receive. You hereby consent to receive a text message confirming that you have unsubscribed, as well as other non-promotional text messages. To the extent you subscribe to more than one Ralph Lauren text message program, you must unsubscribe from each program separately.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you are the age of majority where you reside.</p>
<p>The Program may not be available in all areas or supported by all carriers or all devices. Check with your carrier for details. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
