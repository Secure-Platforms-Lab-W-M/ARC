<p>Applies to all customers buying product from Fastenal.</p>
<h3>Product Selection and Suitability</h3>
<p>Most products offered by Fastenal are obtained from multiple supply sources, located throughout the United States and internationally. Many states and localities have codes and regulations governing sales, construction, installation, and/or use of products for certain purposes, which may vary from those in neighboring areas. While Fastenal attempts to assure that its Products (“Product”) comply with such codes, it cannot guarantee compliance, and cannot be responsible for how the Product is installed or used. Fastenal makes every reasonable attempt to ensure the quality of these supply sources and the Products they offer. As these Products are dynamic and versatile, Fastenal shall not be responsible for how Products are used or installed and the Product's conformance to local or regional codes or regulations. Review the Product materials and application, and relevant code, regulations or ordinances, to be certain that the Product, its installation, and use will satisfy these requirements. In no event will Fastenal be responsible for any loss or damage arising out of Purchaser's improper selection, misapplication or misuse of a Product.</p>
<p>Provided&nbsp;you are purchasing services and Fastenal is performing repairs or inspection related services in connection with certain goods, the&nbsp;<span>“Terms of Tool Repair and Inspection Service"</span>&nbsp;described in this Legal Information page will be applicable, in addition to these Terms of Purchase.</p>
<h3>Limited Warranty</h3>
<p>Fastenal warrants, for a period of one (1) year after delivery, that all Products delivered to you ("Purchaser") hereunder shall be free from any defects in material or workmanship and in conformity with any applicable specifications. Such warranty only extends to Purchaser. Purchaser shall inspect Products within a reasonable time after receipt, and shall promptly notify Fastenal of any claimed defect or nonconformity. Any Products determined to be defective in material or workmanship must be returned, with an invoice and/or control number to a Fastenal branch or authorized location, shipping costs to be prepaid by Purchaser, within the one-year warranty period. Correction shall be made or replacement Products shall be delivered by Fastenal, unless prevented by conditions not subject to Fastenal's control. This warranty shall not be applicable in the event of the misapplication or misuse of the Product by Purchaser. Fastenal makes no warranties to those defined as consumers in the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act. THE FOREGOING WARRANTIES ARE IN PLACE OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AND FASTENAL COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE BY FASTENAL, OTHER THAN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THE ABOVE WARRANTY SECTION. FASTENAL DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PRODUCT DEFECT CLAIMS THAT ARE DUE TO THE MISUSE, IMPROPER SELECTION OR MISAPPLICATION OF THE PRODUCT.</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR INJURIES TO PERSONS OR TO PROPERTY OR LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF FUTURE BUSINESS OR REPUTATION, WHETHER BASED ON TORT OR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL FASTENAL'S LIABILITY FOR PURCHASER'S DIRECT DAMAGES EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT.</p>
<h3>Cancellation and Returns</h3>
<p>Fastenal must approve cancellation of any order prior to shipment. Orders for Special or Non-standard Products (not in the catalogue) may not be cancelled or returned. Any returns for shipping errors, damage or loss upon delivery must be reported within 10 days of the delivery date. Except as otherwise agreed, Products will not be accepted for return after 30 days from the date of delivery to the Purchaser. Any cancellation or returns accepted after 30 days may be subject to a restocking fee and other charges, for which the Purchaser shall be responsible. All returns should be made to a Fastenal branch or as otherwise designated by Fastenal, and must be in resalable condition and accompanied with an Invoice.</p>
<h3>Security Interest</h3>
<p>Purchaser grants to Fastenal a priority lien, purchase money security interest in the Products and any accounts receivable or cash from the resale of the Products until full payment is received, with respect to any sales on open account. Purchaser shall complete and cooperate with the submission of any documents necessary to validate or enforce Fastenal's rights hereunder.</p>
<h3>Published Product Information</h3>
<p>Fastenal reasonably attempts to maintain up-to-date and accurate pricing, availability and usage information about the Products contained in its catalogs. However, this information is dependent upon information distributed by and obtained from a manufacturer or supplier and is subject to change at any time. Fastenal reserves the right to revise catalog information at any time, without notice, and Fastenal will not be responsible for any pricing errors contained therein. FASTENAL MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ITS CATALOGS.</p>
<h3>California Proposition 65 and OSHA Hazardous Substance Information</h3>
<p>Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which are applicable to certain Products that contain materials defined by for OSHA as defining hazardous substances and a list of Products known by the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive harm, are available on this Site, or may be obtained by contacting at your local Fastenal branch store, or by contacting Fastenal's product support division at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:productsupport@fastenal.com">productsupport@fastenal.com</a>. The information and recommendations contained on the SDS supplied by the manufacturer is considered to be accurate and reliable. Purchaser represents it is purchasing Products as its “materials of trade,” as defined in the Hazardous Materials Regulations in Title 49 of the Code of U.S. Federal Regulations and the Products shall be used in direct support of its business, such business does not concern transportation, and such Products shall not be resold or transported in a vehicle other than one owned by itself. Fastenal does not, however, make any warranty concerning the accuracy of the information or the suitability of the recommendations. Fastenal disclaims any and all liability to Purchaser and/or any other user.</p>
<p>Proposition 65 (Prop 65) is a California law that requires the state to keep a list of chemicals that the State of California has identified may cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. If a Product contains a chemical on the list, the State of California requires businesses doing business in the State of California to provide a 'reasonable warning' before potentially exposing Californians to the chemicals. Fastenal will attempt to reasonably identify the Products that may be subject to this regulation and such Products are being offered and distributed with the following Proposition 65 notice:</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.</strong></p>
<p>As there are many chemicals used throughout the manufacturing processes, Fastenal Products may contain a trace amount of any of the 850+ chemicals on the California Proposition 65 warning list. The list of chemicals and metals covered by Prop 65 now exceeds 850, and the List continues to grow every year. For a complete listing, visit www.oehha.org/prop65.html</p>
<h3>Force Majeure</h3>
<p>Fastenal will not be liable or held responsible for any delays or losses resulting, directly or indirectly from Acts of God, severe weather conditions, labor disputes, governmental actions, inability to obtain permits, licenses, raw materials or shipments of Product, war, riots, shortages and any other circumstances or causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
<h3>Governing Law</h3>

Any estimates provided will become invalid after the Tool is returned to the Purchaser or any time period stated in the quotation.</p>
<p>2.All Tools received will be repaired up to the FastFix Rate, WITHOUT an estimate. FastFix Rate pricing is based on average repair charges performed on industrial grade Tools.

In addition to the warranties provided under provision 3 above, the Purchaser may be entitled to additional warranties as afforded by the manufacturer.

<h3>Conflict Minerals</h3>
<p>“Conflict Minerals” refers to tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, which are derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite, regardless of where they are sourced, processed or sold. There is an increasing awareness of violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from an area described as the “Conflict Region”, located in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. As a result, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (‘Act’) of 2010 directed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to adopt rules to implement disclosure requirements related to these “Conflict Minerals”. These rules apply to manufacturers who file periodic reports with the SEC and who manufacture or contract to manufacture products containing “conflict minerals” that are “necessary to the functionality or production” of those products. These manufacturers are required to make inquiries as to the origin of these “conflict minerals” and file a report with the SEC to describe and disclose the results of those inquiries.</p>
<p>To ensure compliance with the Act, our Sellers are required to undertake reasonable due diligence with their supply chains to determine whether the specified metals, if any exist in their respective products, are being sourced from:</p>
<p>1. Mines and smelters outside the Conflict Region&nbsp;<strong>or</strong><br>2. Mines and smelters which have been certified by an independent third party as “conflict free”, if sourced within the Conflict Region.</p>
<p>Sellers are required to provide written documentation to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:conflictminerals@fastenal.com">conflictminerals@fastenal.com</a>&nbsp;to confirm whether the raw materials tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold used in the manufacture of the products supplied to Fastenal originated from outside the Conflict Region or, if the raw material originated from within the Conflict Region, that the mines or smelters are certified as “conflict free” by an independent third party. Fastenal’s Conflict Mineral Reports are available on the Investor Relations page:&nbsp;<a href="http://investor.fastenal.com/" target="_blank">investor.fastenal.com</a>.</p>
<h3>California Proposition 65</h3>
<p>Proposition 65, the Safe and Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986. The Proposition was intended to protect California (USA) citizens and the State’s drinking water sources from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals. In order to notify customers of possible exposure at the point of sale and on Fastenal.com, Seller must notify Fastenal (<a href="mailto:productcompliance@fastenal.com">productcompliance@fastenal.com</a>) if product contains chemicals covered by this Act that meet or exceed Safe Harbor levels that require a ‘reasonable warning’ and validate that the items are properly labeled for sale in California (USA). The list of chemicals and metals covered by Prop 65 now exceeds 900, and the list continues to grow every year.

<p><strong>CA Prop65:</strong>Proposition 65, the Safe and Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, was enacted as a ballot initiative in November 1986.
