<p>However, while we may <em>receive</em> this kind of information, individuals in their individual capacity- as opposed to their capacity as a representative of a company—are not our consumer or customer as those terms are defined in the GLBA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, as required by GLBA, we protect that information to keep it confidential and secure, and we do not share or use this kind of information other than as necessary for providing the financial product or service. If you have questions about how information about you is collected and used in connection with a financial product for you, your family or our household, please contact your financial institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In connection with providing financial services or products, we may also receive or obtain information about your creditworthiness or insurability subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. We need to handle and share this personal information to run our everyday business. We may use and share this information:</p>



<ul><li>For our everyday business purposes — such as to process transactions, maintain accounts, respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus.</li></ul>



<p>You cannot limit the use or sharing of FCRA data for these purposes. Federal law gives you the right to limit only:</p>



<ul><li>Sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness or insurability.</li><li>Affiliates from using your information to market to you.</li><li>Sharing for non-affiliates to market to you.</li></ul>



<p>We do not share information for these purposes. Should we share information for these purposes in the future, we will notify you before doing so and you will have the right to opt-out of that sharing.</p>

<p>We retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary in accordance with our document retention policy and in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or for dealing with complaints, legal challenges or prospective litigation.</p>



<p>We consider the following criteria when determining how long a particular record will be retained, including any personal information contained in that record:</p>



<ul><li>How long the record is needed to provide you with the products and services you request.</li><li>How long the record is needed to support and enhance our operational processes.</li><li>How long the record is needed to protect our rights and legal interests.</li><li>How long the record must be retained to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</li></ul>



<p>The same personal information about you may be included in more than one record and used for more than one purpose, each of which may be subject to different retention periods based on the factors listed above.</p>



<p>For example, where you purchase our insurance product, information will be held for the duration of your insurance cover and a period of several years after the end of our relationship. We keep information after our relationship ends in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and for use in connection with any legal claims brought under or in connection with your policy.</p>



<p>Once your Personal Data is no longer required, it will be securely deleted.</p>
