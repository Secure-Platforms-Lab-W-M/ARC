</ul>
<p>To the extent we maintain and use personal information in a deidentified form , we will not attempt to reidentify the information, except for the purpose of determining whether our deidentification processes satisfy our legal obligations.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How We Share Information</h2>
<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we disclose information in the following situations as permitted by law:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliates and Acquisitions.</strong> Where permitted by law, and as consistent with the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, we may share information with our family of brands and corporate affiliates (e.g., parent company, sister companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control). If another company acquires, or plans to acquire, our company, business, or our assets, we will also share information with that company, including at the negotiation stage.</li>
<li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with business partners, such as service providers, vendors, sales brokers, and retail partners (and their service providers). Among other things, business partners may help us to administer our website, assist or support our business operations, conduct surveys, provide technical support, conduct research and analysis, process payments, and assist in the fulfillment of orders.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Process.</strong> We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, to comply with relevant laws, or to respond to requests from public and government authorities. We may also share your information in order to enforce our terms and conditions, to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third-party intermediary.</li>
<li><strong>Public.</strong> We may offer community features and public interactive forums through our websites, such as discussion boards, product reviews, chat rooms, forums, wikis, social networking platforms and blogs. If you decide to submit information on these pages, that information may be publicly available.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Promotion.</strong> We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third-party partners. If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third-party partner the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them. Their use of your information is not governed by this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Wedding, Baby, and/or Gift Registry.</strong> Some of our websites provide the opportunity to create public registries where you can indicate to others what types of products you might be interested in receiving. The information that you provide about your event (<em>e.g.,</em> name, date, location, etc.) as part of a public registry may be publicly available to permit your guests to search for your registry. In some cases, we may provide you with options to restrict the extent to which that information will be made available to the public. We may also share your information with third-party wedding and gift registry portal sites. Among other things this provides your guests with additional means of finding your registry and coordinating gifts.</li>
<li><strong>Other Disclosures with Your Consent.</strong> We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>Depending on your state and country of residence, you can make the following choices regarding your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to Your Personal Information.</strong> You may request confirmation on whether we are processing your personal information and request access to the personal information that we have about you, including related information, or a copy of that information, by following the instructions described in the Contact Information section below. In certain circumstances, you may request portability of your personal information. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the personal information that we have about you.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to Your Personal Information.</strong> You may request your personal information be corrected. Note that we rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Most of our websites allow you to modify or delete your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law. If our website does not permit you to update or correct certain information, contact us by following the instructions described in the Contact Information section below.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion of Your Personal Information.</strong> You may request that we delete your personal information by following the instructions described in the Contact Information section below. If required by law we will grant a request to delete information, but you should note that in certain situations, and to the extent permitted by law, we may keep your personal information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, complete transactions, provide requested goods or services, identify or repair errors, or prevent inadvertent discrimination against those who exercise their privacy rights. We may also keep your information in order to use it in a manner that is aligned with the reasonable expectations of individuals or is compatible with the context in which it was provided to us.</li>
<li><strong>Objection to Certain Processing.</strong> In some circumstances, you may object to our use and/or our disclosure of your personal information by following the instructions described in the Contact Information section below.</li>
<li><strong>Revocation of Consent.</strong> If you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you services. You may revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based upon consent) by following the instructions described in the Contact Information section below.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Track (“DNT”) Feature.</strong> We do not currently recognize the “Do Not Track” signal.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Marketing Communications.</strong> We will only use your personal information for our direct marketing purposes and/or share your personal information with third parties for our direct marketing purposes as specified in this Privacy Policy. For example, you may choose to provide us with your email address or mailing address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You may request to opt-out/unsubscribe from direct marketing communications at any time by contacting us using the information in the Contact Information section below, or by clicking the unsubscribe link within the email we sent. If you receive a text message from us that contains promotional information you can opt-out of receiving future text messages by replying “STOP,” “UNSUBSCRIBE” or other similar responses as described in the text message. You can stop receiving physical mail offers by emailing us with “NO SNAIL MAIL” in the subject line along with your name, address and ZIP code. We will process your opt-out/unsubscribe request in accordance with applicable laws and without charge. If you decide not to receive promotional offers, we may still send you service-related communications. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies.</strong> Most web browsers allow you to reject or delete cookies through their settings preferences. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. For more information about how certain of our websites use cookies and, where applicable, to update your preferences, click the “Cookie Settings” link available on the applicable website.</li>
<li><strong>Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising</strong>. You may opt-out of targeted advertising (e.g., cookies) by clicking the “Do Not Share My Personal Information” link on the applicable homepage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submitting Requests</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law. If you disagree with how we handled a request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at <a title="mailto:privacyinfo@clorox.com" contenteditable="false" href="mailto:privacyinfo@clorox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacyinfo@clorox.com</a> with the subject line “Appeal.”</p>
<p>Please note that to protect your information we must be able to verify your identity before we can process your request to exercise any of the foregoing privacy rights. We may conduct the verification process by email or phone, and we may ask you to provide information such as your name, contact information, and any additional relevant information based on your relationship with us.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, certain individuals may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on their behalf. To do so, you must provide that authorized agent written and signed permission to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. Note that we may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of another person, you must attach a copy of a completed <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Authorized-Agent-Designation-Form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authorized Agent Designation </a>form indicating that you are able to act on that other person’s behalf.</p>

<h2>How We Protect and Retain Personal Information</h2>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach affecting your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account. When you do you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, selecting a strong password and constructing a unique password. You are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
<p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we obtained the information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as applicable legal requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Other Important Information</h2>
<p>The following additional information relates to our privacy practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children.</strong> Our websites and online services are not intended for children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 18, without parental consent. Children under the age of 18 should not provide their personal information to us.</li>
<li><strong>International Data Transfers.</strong> As a multi-national company, we transmit information between and among our affiliates. As a result, your information may be processed in a foreign country where privacy laws may be less stringent than the laws in your country. Nonetheless, where possible we take steps to treat personal information using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information. For example, when we transmit information from Europe to the United States, we rely upon Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European commission for the transfer of data. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States. If you would like more information concerning our foreign processing policies and arrangements, including attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information below.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Applications/Websites.</strong> We have no control over the privacy practices of websites or applications that we do not own. Any personal information that you provide through third party websites, applications or other means will be governed by the privacy policies applicable to those third parties and mediums.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy.</strong> We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices, technology, legal requirements and other factors. When changes are made to this Privacy Policy, they will become immediately effective when published. You can check the “Last Updated” legend at the bottom of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.</li>
