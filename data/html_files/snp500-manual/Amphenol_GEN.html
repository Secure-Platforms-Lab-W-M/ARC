<h2>Your Rights Under Applicable Laws</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights to your personal data processed by Amphenol. You can find more information about these rights, and how to exercise them, by contacting us. Please note that we may request additional information to respond to or fulfill any requests regarding your rights under applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<h3>EU residents</h3>
<p>GDPR requires Amphenol to provide additional information about how Amphenol processes the personal data of individuals resident within the EU. The GDPR governs the use of “personal data”, which is any information that identifies or from which an individual could be identified, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to an individual’s identity. Amphenol processes personal data for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to provide goods and/or services pursuant to an agreement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where required by the law of the EU or its member states; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where Amphenol has legitimate business interest in doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The GDPR provides EU residents with certain rights in relation to the processing of their personal data, including the right to request access, to have personal data rectified or erased, to object to its processing or to have access to personal data restricted. Amphenol respects individuals’ rights under the GDPR, and we may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before providing individuals with access to their personal data. There may also be circumstances where Amphenol is permitted by law to deny access. We have implemented appropriate safeguards, to protect your personal data when it is transferred, including the execution of data transfer agreements with recipients of the information.</p>
<h3>California residents</h3>
<p>CCPA governs the use of “personal information”, which includes any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household.</p>
<p>If you are a California consumer, you may have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in CCPA, to request that companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>disclose certain information to you about their collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information over the past 12 months and to request access to such information; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delete any of your personal information that it has collected from you and retained;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not sell your personal information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>California consumers also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment if they exercise the rights list above.</p>
<p>When you make a request, we may require that you provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify the request and your jurisdiction before responding to it. The verification steps we take may differ depending on the request you make. We will match the information that you provide in your request to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify your request, we may ask you for additional information to help us verify your request. California consumers will be required to submit their first and last name and email address and may also be asked to provide their telephone number or address so that we can verify the request. Please provide as much of the requested information as possible to help us verify the request. We will only use the information received in a request for the purposes of responding to the request.</p>
<p>The CCPA permits California consumers to use an authorized agent to make privacy rights requests. We require the authorized agent to provide us with proof of the California consumer’s written permission (for example, a power of attorney) that shows the authorized agent has the authority to submit a request for the California consumer. An authorized agent must follow the process described above to make a request. The authorized agent must also verify his/her own identity. We will confirm the agent’s authority with the California consumer about whom the request was made.</p>
<p>We are not required to respond to a consumer’s requests for access or disclosure of personal information more than twice in a twelve (12) month period.</p>
<p>We do not share personal information with other people or non-affiliated businesses for their direct marketing purposes. We are not currently selling your personal information.</p>
<h3>Nevada residents</h3>
<p>Although Amphenol does not sell “personal information”, Nevada residents have the right to submit a verified request directing Amphenol not to sell their personal information. If you are a Nevada resident, and would like to submit such a request, please send your request through any of the methods noted below.</p>
<h3>Exercising your rights</h3>
<p>To exercise any of the rights described above, you can reach us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:LegalDepartment@amphenol.com?Subject=Privacy Policy from www.amphenol.com">LegalDepartment@amphenol.com</a>.</p>

If we determine that such information has been inadvertently collected on anyone under the age of 13, we will take the necessary steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our systems.</p>
