<p>We may use personal information to personalize your experience interacting with us on the Website, including by presenting products and offers tailored to you, and for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing our Website and new products and services, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and operating and expanding our business activities.</p>
<p>In the event that CVS&nbsp;Health or some or all of our business, assets or stock are sold or transferred (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) or used as security, or to the extent we engage in business negotiations with third parties, personal information may be transferred to or shared with third parties as part of any such transaction or negotiation.</p>

<p>We may use and disclose information that does not personally identify you (including the information described under “Cookies and Other Technologies,” below) for any purpose, except to the extent limited by applicable law. If we are required to treat such information as personal information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information.</p>
<p>We may combine information that does not personally identify you with personal information. If we do, we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>
<h2>Social media</h2>
<p>We may use and disclose your personal information to facilitate social media sharing functionality that you initiate. If you choose to connect your social media account (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) with the Website or otherwise engage in social sharing on the Website, your personal information may be shared with your friends, contacts or others associated with your social media account, with other Website users, and with your social media account provider. By connecting the Website and your social media account or contacting us via social media, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>For example, if you utilize a social media feature such as the Facebook “Like” button, Google Plus, Pinterest or a Twitter widget, these features may collect information about your IP address and which page you're visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.</p>
<p>We may display targeted ads to you through social media platforms. These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits, such as where they live or have expressed an interest. We do not share any of your personally identifiable information with social media platforms. See the policies of each social media platform for additional information about these types of ads, including how to manage your display settings for these ads.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>The Website may contain links to, or otherwise make available, third-party websites, services, or other resources not operated by us or on our behalf (“Third Party Services”). These links are provided as a convenience only and do not constitute an affiliation with, endorsement or sponsorship of the Third Party Services. Any information you provide to such third parties is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy or security of the information you provide to them or their handling of your information.

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We seek to use reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect personal information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately contact us in accordance with the “Contact Information” section below.</p>
<h2>Cookies and other technologies</h2>
<p>Like many other websites and online services, we collect information about the Website’s traffic and usage patterns through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other, similar technologies. We use this information for various purposes, such as to ensure that the Website functions properly, to facilitate navigation, to personalize your experience, to understand use of the Website, to diagnose problems, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns and target advertisements, and to otherwise administer the Website.</p>
<p>Cookies are small computer files we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. These small text files help us personalize content on our pages. Your browser software can be set to reject or accept cookies. Instructions for resetting the browser are available in the Help section of most browsers.</p>
<p>Our use of cookies also allows us to collect and receive certain information about a website user, such as the type of web browser used by our customer. Reviewing our web server logs and our customers’ use of our site helps us to, among other purposes, statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose.</p>
<p>Pixel tags are a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is open. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p>
<p>Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our web server log files whenever a user accesses the Website, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Website, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Website.</p>
<p>We may use Adobe Flash Local Stored Objects (“LSOs”) and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Website. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.</p>
<h2>Tracking/Third-party advertisers</h2>
<p>We may use or partner third-party advertising companies, including social media companies like Facebook, as well as third-party advertising companies to provide measurements services and display targeted advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Website; these targeted advertisements are based on information relating to your access to and use of the Website and of other online services. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, including through the use of pixel tags, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Website and elsewhere on the internet. We may use analytics providers that use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other, similar technologies to collect or receive information about your use of the Website and your use of other websites or online services.</p>
<p>You may opt out of the collection and use of information for advertisement targeting, at any time. To acquire further information and exercise your right to opt out, you may defer to consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs, such as:</p>
