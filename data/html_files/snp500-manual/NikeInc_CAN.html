<li>Personal preferences including your wish list as well as marketing and cookie preferences</li>
</ul><p>We use additional personal data in order to enable particular features within our Sites and Apps or services.&nbsp; For example, we request access to your phone’s geolocation data in order to log your run route, your contacts to allow you to interact with your friends, your calendar to schedule a training plan or your social network credentials in order to post content from an App to a social network.&nbsp; This personal data includes your:</p>

<li>Photos, contacts and calendar information</li>
<li>Sensor data, including heart rate and (GPS) location data</li>
<li>Social network information, including credentials and any information from your public posts about Nike or your communications with us</li>
</ul><p>When interacting with our Sites and Apps, data is automatically collected and shared with Nike by the technology platforms providing the experience.&nbsp; For example, your web browser or mobile device may share certain data with Nike as those devices interact with Nike’s Sites or Apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; More information about these practices is included in the Cookies and Pixel Tags section below.&nbsp; This data includes:</p>
<ul><li>Device IDs, call state, network access, storage information and battery information</li>
<li>Cookies, IP addresses, referrer headers, data identifying your web browser and version, and web beacons and tags</li>
</ul><p><strong>Tools to Manage What We Collect</strong></p>
<p>When using our Apps, we also inform you about our collection and use through standard permissions in app stores, mobile operating systems, and in the App experience. We also prompt you for your consent where necessary.</p>
<p>In many cases, your web browser or mobile device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to control when your device collects or shares particular categories of information.&nbsp; For example, your mobile device or web browser may offer tools to allow you to manage cookie usage or location sharing.&nbsp; We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and use the tools available on your devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHY and HOW We Use (Process) Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We use the personal data we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>To Provide the Features of the Sites, Apps, and Services You Request</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>When you use our Sites and Apps, we will use your data to provide the product or service you have selected.&nbsp; For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion. If you reach out to our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use our Apps to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this data and store it so that you can review it in the App.&nbsp; Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity as well as data collected by your device during the course of your activity such as location data and movement data.&nbsp; We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many cases, to use particular features within our Sites, Apps, and services you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.&nbsp; For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Apps, you may need to connect a heart rate monitoring device to the experience; to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials.</p>
<p><strong>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</strong></p>
<p>To modify your (email or SMS) subscriptions or to opt-out of receiving Nike communication, please modify your preferences in the "view or change my profile" section of our Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also contact us to exercise your rights related to your personal data via the contact details in the “Question and Feedback” section below or by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@nike.com">privacy@nike.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the email address provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, unless you have opted-out. In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information about Nike’s products, services, events and promotions. We may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or services - such as your use of Nike’s Sites and Apps, your visits to or purchases made in Nike stores, your participation in Nike events and contests (possibly through other Nike affiliates) - to personalize communications on products and services that may be interesting for you. Where legally required, we will also seek your consent for sending marketing communications.</p>
<p><strong>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use the data you provide to us to operate our business.&nbsp; For example, when you make a purchase, we may use that information for accounting, auditing and other internal functions.&nbsp; As another example, we may use data about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Sites and Apps.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use data about how you use our Sites and Apps to prevent or detect fraud, abuse, illegal uses and violations of our Terms of Use and to comply with court orders, governmental request or applicable law.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For General Research and Analysis Purposes</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use data about how our visitors use our Sites, Apps and Services to understand customer behavior or preferences.&nbsp; For example, we may use information about how visitors to Nike.com search for and find products to better understand the best ways to organize and present product offerings in our storefront.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Use (Processing) of Workout Info</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, Nike collects data about your fitness activity or your physical characteristics (together, Workout Info) in order to provide our Apps and other services.&nbsp; Because of the personal nature of this data, we strive to provide you with clear information about how Workout Info will be used.&nbsp; As this data may be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions, we take appropriate measures in protecting and using this data and, where required by applicable law or under Nike’s internal policies, will obtain your consent for use of your Workout Info.&nbsp; Click here <a href="http://agreementservice.svs.nike.com/ca/en_gb/rest/agreement?requestType=redirect&amp;agreementType=DataLearnMore&amp;country=CA&amp;language=en&amp;uxId=com.nike.commerce.nikedotcom.web" shape="rect">Link to FAQ on Workout Info</a> to learn more.</p>

</ul><p><strong>COOKIES and Pixel Tags</strong></p>

<p>Third parties may also collect information via Sites through cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets. These third parties collect data directly from your web browser and the processing of this data is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers’ usage of the Sites and to understand our customers’ preferences (such as country and language choices). This enables us to provide services to our customers and improve their online experience. We also use cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Sites. There are generally three categories of cookies used on our Sites:</p>
<ul type="disc"><ul><li><strong>Functional:&nbsp;</strong>These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always enabled. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Sites within a single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping cart and checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.</li>
</ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: These cookies allow us to improve our Sites’ functionality by tracking usage. In some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember site preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored recommendations and slow site performance.</li>
</ul><ul type="disc"><ul><li><strong>Social media and Advertising</strong>: Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social networks and share content from our Sites through social media.&nbsp; Advertising cookies (of third parties) collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within and beyond our Sites. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data. Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.</li>
</ul></ul><p>For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through Nike Sites or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose.&nbsp; You can also choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features that make our Sites and Apps more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>
<p><strong>USING Nike Sites and Apps with Third-Party Products and Services</strong></p>
<p>Our Sites and Apps allow you to interact with a wide variety of other digital products and services.&nbsp; For example, our Sites and Apps can integrate with third-party devices for activity tracking, social networks, music streaming services and other digital services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to connect your Nike account with a third-party device or account, your privacy rights on third-party platforms will be governed by their respective policies.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to share your Nike activity on third-party social media platforms, the policies of those platforms govern the data that resides there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Sites and Apps may provide links to other (third-party) websites and apps for your convenience or information. Linked sites and apps have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly encourage you to review. To the extent any linked websites or apps are not owned or controlled by us, we are not responsible for their content, any use of the websites or apps, or the privacy practices of the websites or apps.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES to our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Applicable law and our practices change over time. If we decide to update our Policy, we will post the changes on our Sites and Apps. If we materially change the way in which we process personal data, we will provide you with prior notice, or where legally required, request your consent prior to implementing such changes. We strongly encourage you to read our Policy and keep yourself informed of our practices. This Policy was last modified in January 2018.</p>
