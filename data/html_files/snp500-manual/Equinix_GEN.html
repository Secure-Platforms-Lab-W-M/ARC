    <p>We may collect Personal Data from you and about you from a variety of sources. We strive to only collect Personal Data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected. In addition, we strive to keep all Personal Data accurate, complete, and reliable for its intended need, and we only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected, as explained more fully in the section&nbsp;“How Long We Retain Your Personal Data”. Finally, we may, from time to time, provide you with supplemental information at the time we collect your Personal Data to address unique or situational collection needs.</p>
<p>Examples of the ways in which we collect your Personal Data include:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Information You Share with Us.</b>&nbsp;We collect Personal Data when you provide it to us directly, such as through our business interactions with you; when you visit one of our office locations or IBX Data Centers; when you provide it to us throughout an employment or pre-employment relationship; when you respond to a survey that we sent you; or when you interact with us on our website, our online customer portals, or through social media.<br>
<br>
For example, if you visit one of our office locations, we may ask that you provide us your first and last name, business association, and email address in order to identify you as a visitor. Likewise, when you visit one of our IBX Data Centers, we may require you to provide us your first and last name, business association, job title or position, telephone number, email address, photo, and certain biometric information, such as a hand scan or other biometric-assessment technology developed in the future that Equinix may adopt.<br>
<br>
Likewise, if you contact us with questions, requests, or complaints, we may collect Personal Data sufficient to answer your questions, address your requests, and/or handle your complaints. We may also require you to provide Personal Data to authenticate your identity in order to answer your questions, address your requests, and/or handle your complaints.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Information Collected through a Representative.</b>&nbsp;We collect Personal Data when a representative from an organization or company with which you are associated provides it to us directly, such as through the provision of access credentials to our customer portals.<br>
<br>
Equinix provides several online accounts for its customers to provide a variety of services. These online accounts include the customer portals such as the Equinix Customer Portal, the Equinix Marketplace Portal, and the Equinix Fabric Portal (not an exhaustive list; collectively, the “Equinix Portals”, “Customer Portal(s)” or “Portal(s)”). Each Portal requires individualized access credentials in order to log in, which are provisioned based on your first and last name, email address, business telephone number, and the company or organization with which you are associated. &nbsp;We also use automated technologies to improve your experience of the Portals (see “Information Collected Automatically” below).<br>
<br>
For example, the Equinix Customer Portal allows registered Equinix customers to purchase additional Equinix Licensed Space and Services (as defined within relevant agreements with us) and to gain access to relevant information about the customer’s business relationship with Equinix. If you are associated with an Equinix customer that has access to the Equinix Customer Portal, a representative from your organization may provide us with your first and last name, business telephone number, and email address in order for us to provide you access credentials.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Information Collected Automatically.</b>&nbsp;We collect Personal Data automatically when you visit our website through logging and analytics tools, cookies, and as a result of your use of and access to our Portals. &nbsp;More information about cookies and similar technologies used in our websites (including our Portals) can be found in the section “Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” below.<br>
<br>
Personal Data that we automatically collect may include the software and hardware attributes of the device you use to access our website and online services (such as our online employee or customer portals); unique device identification information; regional and language settings; performance data about our website and online services; network provider; and IP address (a number assigned to your device when you use the Internet).<br>
<br>
<i>Location Information</i>: If you permit us to access information about your location (including global positioning system or general location information derived from the network you use to access the Services), we collect the precise or general location information provided by your device to appropriately tailor certain regional settings, such as preferred language.<br>
<br>
<i>Cookies, Web Tracking, and Advertising</i>: We use cookies to personalize and enhance your experience online, to collect data about your visit to our website, to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website and our online services, to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns, and to permit analytics providers to gather information about your visit.<br>
<br>
Please see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.equinix.com/about/legal/cookie-notice" target="_self">Cookie Notice</a>&nbsp;for more information about cookies and other web tracking technologies that we utilize; for information about how you can reject, delete, or prevent cookies from being placed on your system or device; and how you can opt out of, limit, or prevent certain web tracking technologies from collecting information about you.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Information Obtained from Third Parties.</b>&nbsp;We collect Personal Data from third-party sources, including our service providers, such as Google Analytics and Google Adwords, Demandbase, Marketo, and Techtarget; through your interactions with us on social media; through industry, marketing, or trade associations events; and through database providers, public agencies, or credit bureaus.<br>
<br>
For example, if you attend an industry conference and allow the association to publish your Personal Data, we may collect information, such as your name, the business with which you are associated, your job title or position, and your email address. Likewise, if you apply for employment with us, we may perform certain diligence efforts that include collecting your Personal Data from public agencies and/or credit bureaus.<br>
<br>
In addition, if you choose to interact with us or our partners on social media by posting to our pages, tagging us (or using certain hashtags or other identifiers) in posts, or participating in activities, we may collect Personal Data from the social media account you use to interact with us, including the name associated with the account, the account handle, recent activity, the content of any posts in which we are tagged, and other information that may be contained on your social media profile to allow us to respond to the posts and understand and engage with our audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have choices about certain information we collect. When you are asked to provide your Personal Data, you may decline to do so; but if you choose not to provide your Personal Data that is necessary for us to provide any aspect of our services, you may not be able to use those services.</p>
<p>Moreover, to the extent that Personal Data you share with us is not your own (because, for example, you are a representative of an Equinix customer), you warrant that you have the right to provide such Personal Data, and you and the business with which you are associated shall be fully responsible for any liability arising from any such use of Personal Data, including indemnifying Equinix from any such liability. If you share Personal Data with us that is not your own, you agree to inform your agents, employees, or any authorized personnel (e.g., contractors, partners, or authorized third parties) (i) that their Personal Data may be processed by us; and (ii) of their rights regarding the processing of their Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable data privacy and protection law.</p>
<p>Finally, we may collect data that is not identifiable to you or otherwise associated with you, such as aggregated data, which is not Personal Data. To the extent this data is stored or associated with your Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data; otherwise, it is not subject to this Privacy Statement.</p>

    <div><div>
    <p>Equinix, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) takes measures to ensure its proprietary and confidential information remains private, and is committed to state of the art, in-house physical access security, which includes best-in-class processes and procedures and cutting-edge technology.&nbsp; To that end, we maintain a security system for access to our secure locations, such as one of our International Business Exchange Centers (“IBX Centers”).&nbsp; The system limits access to such locations to authorized employees, customers, agents, contractors, vendors, and third-party business partners of the Company (“Authorized Person”).</p>
<p>The Company’s security system utilizes certain data that may be considered biometric data under applicable laws for the purpose of authenticating some Authorized Persons’ identity and allowing those Authorized Persons access to a Company secure location.&nbsp; The Company has developed and published this policy to provide notice to Authorized Persons and ensure such potentially biometric data is reasonably safeguarded and not retained for longer than necessary.&nbsp; This policy governs the collection, use, retention, and destruction of the potentially biometric data we may collect in Illinois and is available to all Company employees and the public in the Privacy Statement section at the Company’s U.S. website.</p>
<p>Because such potentially biometric data is collected during the identity verification and authentication process, this policy is intended to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act.</p>
<p><b>Collection of Potentially Biometric Data.</b></p>
<p>Among the measures taken by the Company to protect its secure locations is the use of hand or finger scanning devices, which, along with an Authorized Person’s unique passcode, authenticate the Authorized Person’s identity. We collect hand or finger scan data to enroll you and provide you with biometrically authenticated access.</p>
<p>Depending on the security system in operation at the IBX Center, the scanning technology measures certain aspects of an Authorized Person’s hand or finger, which are then immediately converted to an encrypted mathematical file (template) based on the distinct characteristics of the hand or finger.&nbsp; The template will then either be stored on a smart card, which we will issue to you, or we will store it on a secure database owned and maintained by the Company. No handprints or fingerprints are retained after we create the template.</p>
<p>Before collecting an Authorized Person’s hand or finger scan data and creating a template, the Company obtains a signed consent and written release from the Authorized Person or the Authorized Person’s legally authorized representative to obtain and use the hand or finger scan data as outlined in this policy.&nbsp; The Company will consider requests from an Authorized Person on an individual basis for accommodation or exemption—in whole or in part—from this policy.</p>
<p><b>Use of Potentially Biometric Data.</b></p>
<p>Where required to access an IBX Center, an Authorized Person must present their unique personalized passcode and provide a non-intrusive hand or finger scan, or the smart card that contains the template, as applicable to the security system in operation at the IBX Center.&nbsp; The Company will use the associated template solely for purposes of authenticating an Authorized Person’s identity to access one of our secure locations.&nbsp; The template derived from the Authorized Person’s hand or finger scan is compared with the template associated with the Authorized Person’s passcode during the initial enrollment process to verify and authenticate the Authorized Person’s identity.</p>
<p><b>How We Provide Access to Potentially Biometric Data.</b></p>
<p>The Company utilizes software and hardware in connection with its security system sourced from third party vendors; however, no third party has access to the templates except as otherwise detailed in this policy.&nbsp; The Company will not sell, lease, trade or otherwise profit from an Authorized Person’s templates. Likewise, the Company will not disclose, re-disclose or otherwise disseminate templates without an Authorized Person’s consent unless required: (1) by any state law, federal law or municipal ordinance; or (2) by valid warrant or valid subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><b>How We Store Potentially Biometric Data.</b></p>
<p>The data obtained from an Authorized Person’s hand scan are converted to an encrypted mathematical file that is then securely retained on applications and infrastructure owned and maintained by the Company.&nbsp; All templates obtained from an Authorized Person’s finger scan are stored on a smart card, which we will issue to you, and are not stored by the Company.</p>
<p><b>How We Retain, Safeguard, and Destroy Potentially Biometric Data.</b></p>
<p>Unless otherwise required by law, the Company will retain an Authorized Person’s templates until the earlier of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an Authorized Person’s Equinix Customer Portal (“ECP”) profile is removed;</li>
<li>An Authorized Person’s IBX Center access is removed;</li>
<li>One year following an Authorized Person’s last access to a secure location using biometric data; or</li>
<li>Upon request to the Equinix Privacy Office from the Authorized Person to permanently destroy the template.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company will permanently destroy an Authorized Person’s template upon expiration of the above-outlined time periods.</p>
<p>During the time of retention, the Company will store and safeguard the Authorized Person’s template using the reasonable standard of care within the industry, and in a manner equally protective as that in which the Company stores, transmits, and protects other confidential and sensitive data.</p>
<p><b>How to Contact Us.</b></p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the site manager or the Equinix Security Desk, who will refer the question to the appropriate Company representative, or contact us at <a href="mailto:PrivacyOffice@equinix.com">PrivacyOffice@equinix.com</a> or <a href="tel:+18669773749">+1.866.977.3749</a>.</p>
<p><b>Updates to this Policy.</b></p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to amend this policy at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If any provision of this policy or any part thereof contravenes any appliable law, or if the operation of any provision is determined by applicable law or otherwise to be unenforceable, then such offending provision or part thereof shall be severed, and the remaining provisions given full force and effect.</p>
<p>Any legal disputes, claims, controversies or disagreements arising out of or relating to this Illinois Biometric Data Policy or the Company’s procedures relating to Authorized Person’s biometric data (“Claim”) shall be resolved by binding arbitration instead of the courts.&nbsp; All Claims may be brought only in the User’s individual capacity, and not as Plaintiff, claimant or class member in a class, collective or other representative or joint proceeding.&nbsp; Arbitration is the exclusive form for the resolution of such Claims, and both the Company and Authorized Persons mutually waive their respective right to a trial before a judge or jury in federal or state court.&nbsp; The binding arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its rules and procedures then in effect, and shall be confidential.&nbsp;</p>
