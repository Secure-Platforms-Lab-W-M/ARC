This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Broadcom collects, stores, uses, and discloses your Personal Data. This Policy is issued on behalf of Broadcom, so a reference to “we”, “us”, or “our” in this Policy is a reference to the relevant company in Broadcom that is responsible for processing your Personal Data.</p><p>Additional privacy information may be provided in offer descriptions, contractual terms, supplemental privacy statements or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. Certain Broadcom products and services may have additional specific privacy notices. In case of conflict, such specific privacy notices shall derogate from this general policy.</p><p>Please note that this Policy only governs Broadcom's collection and processing of your Personal Data in the context of your direct interactions with Broadcom as an individual Data Subject. Where you are the end-user of a Broadcom Product procured by your Organization, then your Organization's own privacy policy is applicable to your use of that Product, and Broadcom will process your Personal Data in that context pursuant to the terms of the Data Processing Agreement in place between your Organization and Broadcom.</p><p><br><strong>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</strong><br>We may ask you to provide us with Personal Data about yourself in order to provide services to you.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by using the contextual preference tools available in the communications or in the user interfaces of the products and services we provide to you. Absent those, please contact us as explained below. However, please note that your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any use of your Personal Data by Broadcom based on your consent prior to withdrawal.</li><li>To fulfill any contractual obligations, such as where you have purchased a product or service from Broadcom. For example, we may require your contact details in order to deliver your order if you have purchased a product from us.</li><li>For compliance with Broadcom’s legal obligations where applicable laws require us to process your Personal Data.</li></ul><p>If you have any questions or would like more information regarding the legal basis on which we collect your Personal Data, please review the supplemental privacy notice(s) of the products or services concerned, or contact us as explained below.</p><p><strong>Processing Of Personal Data For The Purposes Of Fraud Prevention And Network and Information Security</strong><br>On the basis of legitimate interest, we process Personal Data for fraud prevention and network and information security purposes. Pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing fraud and ensuring network and information security. According to the GDPR, network and information security means the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.</p><p>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of payment security services and cybersecurity technologies and services, it is in our legitimate interests as well as in our customers’, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing “Fraudulent Payment Transactions” and ensuring the security of our own, and of our customers’ payment transactions and information networks and systems. This includes the development of payment transaction records and of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis our ability to detect Fraudulent Payment Transactions, and the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events affecting information networks and systems (“Cyber-Threats”).</p><p>The Personal Data we process for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions include, without limitation:</p><ul><li>Information related to electronic means of payment and related entitlements;</li><li>Information related to electronic payment transactions;</li><li>Contextual signals and indicators of suspected fraud;</li><li>Verification information to confirm or dispel suspected fraud; and</li><li>Evidence of suspected, detected and/or confirmed fraud.</li></ul><p>The Personal Data we process for network and information security purposes include, without limitation, network traffic data related to Cyber-Threats such as:</p><ul><li>sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM);</li><li>recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks);</li><li>reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);</li><li>filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);</li><li>URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents); and/or</li><li>IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of Cyber-Threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).</li></ul><p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other data subjects. However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting and mitigating the Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat of concern to you, and to all organizations relying on our products and services to secure their payment transactions, and information networks and systems. When processing Personal Data in this context, we will only seek to identify data subjects:</p><ul><li>to the extent that it is an inherent part to the services that our customers hire us to perform for them, and as such it is strictly indispensable to the prevention of the fraud and/or the remediation of the Cyber-Threat concerned, or</li><li>if and as required by law.</li></ul><p>If you believe that your Personal Data was unduly collected or is unduly processed by Broadcom for such purposes, please refer to the “Your Rights” and “Contact Us” sections below. Please be aware that if it is determined that Personal Data concerning you is processed by Broadcom because it is critical for the prevention of Fraudulent Payment Transactions, or the detection, blocking or mitigation of Cyber-Threats, then in certain cases the legitimate interest to pursue such processing may be compelling enough to override access, objection, rectification or erasure requests related to the data concerned.<br></p><p><strong>Automated Individual Decision-Making And Profiling</strong><br>Where Broadcom processes payment transaction security or network traffic data for the purpose of fraud prevention, respectively network and information security, automated decisions concerning particular payment transactions or cyber events may occasionally be made. This could involve in particular assigning relative payment fraud risk, respectively cybersecurity risk scores to ongoing or recent payment transactions, information network activities or system behaviors. Such automatically-assigned risk scores may be leveraged by you, by Broadcom, by our partners and by other customers to detect, block and mitigate the detected Fraudulent Payment Transaction or Cyber-Threat. They could therefore result in said partners and customers blocking payment transactions they deem to be fraudulent, halting network traffic coming from or going to suspected or known malicious addresses. Such processing is not intended to produce any other effect than protecting you, Broadcom, our partners and our other customers from fraudulent payment transactions, respectively Cyber-Threats. Should you nevertheless consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact directly the relevant data controller whose use of our products and services is thus impacting you. In case that data controller is Broadcom, please refer to the “Your Privacy Rights” and “Contact Us” sections of this Policy to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Processing Of Pseudonymous Data To Improve the Performance of Broadcom Hardware</strong><strong><br></strong>Certain mobile devices equipped with a Broadcom GPS chip occasionally require querying Broadcom's geolocation assistance server. At the user’s request when launching a geolocation service on their device, the chip will transmit to Broadcom over TCP/IP the device's then-current broad city-level location. In response, the server will designate to the chip the then-relevant satellites to connect to. This service reduces the time needed for the chip to achieve accurate GPS location from about 15 minutes to less than 1 minute. Broadcom does not manually access, inspect, disclose, retain, correlate or reuse any of the data associated with this service. The logs related to this service only contain the dynamic IP address from which the device connected to the service, and these logs are purged on a rolling 24-hour basis. Broadcom is not in a position to identify any individual end-user based on the information involved in this service.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>To Whom Do We Disclose Your Information And Why?</strong><br>Broadcom does not sell or share, within the meaning of the California Privacy Rights Act, your personal information. We only disclose your information as described in this Policy. Broadcom processes your information for the purposes described in this policy, which include the above-listed commercial and business purposes in the meaning of the CCPA (see the “How Do We Use Your Information?” section above). We may disclose Personal Data collected about you as follows:<br><br><em><strong>Broadcom Users.&nbsp;</strong></em>Your user name and any information that you post to our Site, including, without limitation, reviews, comments, pictures and text will be available to, and searchable by, all users of the Site.<br><br><em><strong>Affiliates or Subsidiaries.</strong></em>&nbsp;Data we collect from you may be disclosed to our affiliates or subsidiaries.<br><br><em><strong>Unaffiliated Third Parties.</strong></em>&nbsp;Certain data about you may be disclosed to select resellers and/or distributors, particularly if you or your company have purchased through a third party before.<br><br><em><strong>Service Providers.</strong></em>&nbsp;Data we collect from you may be disclosed to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.

If you do not wish Broadcom to sell or share your data in the meaning of the California Privacy Rights Act with such third parties, you may use the Do Not Sell or Share button available in the website’s cookie management tool at any time.</p><p><strong>What About Links To Other Websites?</strong><br>Our Site and services may contain links to third party websites for your convenience. Any access to and use of such linked websites will cause you to leave the Site. Third party websites, even if potentially serving content co-branded by Broadcom, are not governed by this Policy, but instead are governed by their own privacy statements/policies. We recommend that you check the privacy statements/policies of every third party website you visit before providing any Personal Data. We do not control those third party websites and are not responsible for their content or their privacy policies. Thus, we do not endorse or make any legal representations about them. If you decide to access any of the third party websites linked to our Site, you do so entirely at your own risk.<br><br><strong>How Do We Secure Your Personal Data?</strong><br>We have implemented administrative, technical, physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction and to help maintain data accuracy and ensure that your Personal Data is used appropriately. Broadcom has an internal Global Customer Privacy Program. Its charter is to ensure appropriate privacy processes are in place in order to meet the practices outlined herein. Where Personal Data is processed by service providers on behalf of Broadcom, we take steps to require those vendors to also comply with applicable data protection laws.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?</strong><br>We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy and/or in applicable supplemental notices, unless a longer retention period is required by law.<br><br><strong>Your Rights</strong><br>Depending on where you live, you may have the following rights described below with respect to your Personal Data. In particular if the California Privacy Rigths Act (CPRA) applies to your information, we provide these disclosures and the tools described in this Policy so you can exercise your rights to receive information about our data practices, as well as to request access to and deletion of your information. To exercise your rights, you may:</p><ul><li>make use of the self-serve tools available in the products or services you are using;</li><li>submit your privacy request via the <a data-sys-content-type-uid="links" data-sys-entry-locale="en-us" data-sys-entry-uid="bltc03dd1d1717302a0" href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8153b982-ae11-46a0-b7c2-6e4e3b591d72/73e008aa-42d7-4712-a51d-f809b7e2e3c9" target="_blank">Request Intake Form</a>; or</li><li>contact your customer support representative.</li></ul><p>It is our legal obligation to validate any request we receive before responding.

If it is impossible for you to use any of the methods listed above, please contact the Privacy Office as indicated below to find a resolution.</p><p><em><strong>Email and Marketing.</strong></em>&nbsp;In most instances, we give you options with regard to the Personal Data you provide, including choices with respect to marketing materials. You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by: (i) clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of marketing emails; or (ii) checking certain boxes on our preference center which can also be found on certain forms we use to collect Personal Data.</p><p><em><strong>Access</strong></em>. You may request information regarding Personal Data that we collect and hold about you and the source(s) of that information. To access your Personal Data, return to the product, service or web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions in your user interface or on that web page. If you cannot access your information in this way, please submit your request through the appropriate Request Intake Portal indicated above. If none of these options applies, please contact us as described in the “How Can You Contact Us?” section below.<br><br>Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages particularly of the Site for a limited period of time. If you request a change to or deletion of your Personal Data, please note that we may still need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Data provided until after the completion of such purchase). Some of your information may also remain within our systems and other records where necessary for compliance with applicable law.<br><br>You can request a copy of any Personal Data we hold about you, and of which you don’t already have a copy.

Note however that you may be subject to differentiated treatment if and to the extent that the exercise of your rights materially impacts our ability to provide certain services to you (e.g. if you request the deletion of your account information or access credentials, then we may no longer be able to grant you access to restricted areas of our websites). Such differentiated treatment is objectively justified and does not constitute discrimination.</p><p><br><em><strong>Withdraw Consent</strong></em>. You have the right to withdraw consent to us processing your Personal Data. This will not affect the processing already carried out with your consent;</p><p><br><em><strong>Not to be subject to decisions based on automated processing.</strong></em>&nbsp;In some circumstances, you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, and to obtain the human review of any such decisions that significantly affect you (please refer to the earlier section on automated decision making); and</p><p><br><em><strong>Complain</strong></em><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
