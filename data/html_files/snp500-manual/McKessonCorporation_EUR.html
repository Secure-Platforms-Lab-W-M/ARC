<p>It is very important to us that the protection of your privacy is strictly observed when processing personal data.</p><p>In the following we would like to inform you about the handling of your personal data by us in general and in particular when you use our website www.mckesson.eu (hereinafter: "<strong>website</strong>").</p><p>For a simpler overview, we have divided our Privacy Statement into the following areas:</p><p>A: General information<br>Contains all the information that we are obliged to provide you with, such as our contact details, the contact details of our Data Protection Officer and your rights as data subjects.</p><p>B: Data processing when visiting our website<br>Contains all the information related to visiting or actively using our website, for example in the context of using our online application portal.</p><p>C: Data processing not related to website use<br>Contains all the information about data processing, if you are in a business relationship with us, if you visit us on site or if you contact us via other means.</p><h2>A. General information</h2><h3>1. Controller</h3><p>Controller in terms of data protection law is:</p><p><strong>McKesson Europe AG</strong><br>Stockholmer Platz 1<br>70173 Stuttgart, Germany<br>Telephone: +49 711 5001-00<br>Fax: +49 711 5001-1260<br>E-mail: <a href="mailto:service@mckesson.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service@mckesson.eu</a>&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Data Protection Officer&nbsp;</h3><p>For all concerns regarding data protection, our Data Protection Officer is at your disposal:</p><p><strong>– Data Protection Officer –</strong><br>McKesson Europe AG<br>Stockholmer Platz 1<br>70173 Stuttgart, Germany<br>Telephone: +49 711 5001-00<br>Fax: +49 711 5001-1260<br>E-mail: <a href="mailto:privacy@mckesson.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy@mckesson.eu</a>&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Personal Data</h3><p>Personal data refers to all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("<strong>data subject</strong>"). An identifiable natural person is a data subject who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by association with an identifier. An identifier may be, for example, a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, the IP address or other specific features that are the expression of the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (hereinafter collectively referred to as "<strong>data</strong>").</p><h3>4. Data processing by us</h3><p>In general, we process your data in accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and other applicable data protection regulations. Processing only takes place to the extent necessary and that is permitted according to data protection law, for example for the fulfilment of contractual purposes, for the protection of our legitimate interests, for the fulfilment of legal requirements or insofar as you consent to the data processing. The specific nature and extent of the data processing and the corresponding legal bases can be found in the sections "B: Data processing when visiting our website" and "C: Data processing not related to website use".</p><h3>5. Data recipients</h3><p>In general, only those internal departments or organisational units as well as other companies affiliated with us shall receive your data, insofar as this is necessary for the fulfilment of our contractual and legal obligations or if said data is required in the course of processing and implementing our legitimate interests.</p><p>Your data may be transferred to external recipients in connection with contract processing, provided that we are obliged to fulfil legal requirements for information, notification or disclosure of data, you have granted us your consent for the transfer to third parties or to external service providers that render services on behalf of us as data processors or assume functions for us on behalf of us (for example IT service provider, the service provider we use when using our online application portal, data centres, data shredders or courier services). For the sections "B: Data processing when visiting our website" and "C: Data processing not related to website use" you can find case-specific examples of data recipients.</p><h3>6. Third country transfer</h3><p>In the course of the matrix structure of our Group, your data will also be processed within our Group companies that are based in third countries, meaning in countries outside the European Economic Area. These data transfers are covered by an adequacy decision of the European Commission (Article 45 GDPR).&nbsp;Where this is not the case, e.g. when it comes to transfers to the USA, the data transfers are especially based on&nbsp;standard data protection clauses/standard contractual clauses in line with the templates adopted by the European Commission (Article 46 Para. 2 lit. c, Para. 5 S. 2 GDPR) or by an exemption according to Article 49 GDPR.</p><p>The same applies to external service providers who work on behalf of us (for example IT service providers or data centres) or third parties, insofar as they come into contact with your personal data and are based in third countries. This means that we transfer your IP address, for example, as part of the use of the OneTrust and Google Analytics tools, or your shortened IP address to countries outside the European Union, among others in the USA.</p><p>Otherwise, we do not transfer your personal data to countries outside the EU or the EEA or to international organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon request, we will gladly provide you with appropriate detailed information.</p><h3>7. Data deletion and storage duration</h3><p>For the purely informational use of our website, we store your data in accordance with the regulations in Section B.1.1.</p><p>If you actively use our website or in the event of data processing not related to website use, we will store your data for as long as is required, for example, for the provision of the respective service, for example the implementation of the application process. If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, we will store your data until the consent is withdrawn. For details, please refer to the regulations in Section B.1.2 or Section C.</p><p>In addition, we will always store your personal data until the expiration of the limitation period of any legal claims arising from the relationship with you, if necessary, in order to use it as means of evidence. The limitation period is usually between 12 and 36 months. Once the limitation period has expired, we will delete your personal data, unless there is a statutory storage obligation, for example, deriving from the German Commercial Code (Sections 238, 257 Para. 4 HGB) or from the Tax Code (Section 147 Para. 3, 4 AO). These storage requirements can last between two and ten years.</p><h3>8.
