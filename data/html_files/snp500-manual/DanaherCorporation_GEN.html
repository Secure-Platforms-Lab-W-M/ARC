<h2><a><strong>Third-Party Sites and Social Media Plug-ins</strong></a></h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to Danaher Sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy, or to third-party Web sites to which Danaher Sites may link. Danaher Sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button, ‚ÄúShare to Twitter‚Äù button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit Danaher Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site or other sites or services and to receive information that you have visited our Danaher Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our Danaher Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.</p>

<h5>Accessing Our Sites Globally</h5>

<p>This site is owned and operated by Danaher in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries in accordance with this policy.<br>
Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for Personal Data is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Policy in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you understand that your Personal Data will be stored and processed in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Danaher may transmit Personal Data about you to related affiliates worldwide. These affiliates may in turn transmit Personal Data about you to other related affiliates. Some affiliates may be in countries that do not ensure an adequate level of data protection. Nevertheless, all of Danaher‚Äôs related affiliates are required to treat Personal Data in a manner consistent with this policy. We only transfer your Personal Data internationally or to a third-party when we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect the integrity and security of your Personal Data being processed, in compliance with applicable data protection laws. Where necessary, including for transfers to affiliates, we use Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Union to provide such protection.
