In the event of a conflict between any other Company policy, statement or notice and this Notice, this Notice will prevail as to California Consumers and their rights under the CCPA. Please see also any privacy policy or notice of general applicability posted or referenced on our websites, apps, products, or services including, without limitation, avaloncommunities.com; avalonbay.com; and AvalonAccess.com.</p><p>This Notice covers our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of California Consumers’ “Personal Information” (“<strong>PI</strong>”) as defined by the CCPA, except to the extent such PI is exempt from the notice obligations of the CCPA. This Notice also explains the rights California Consumers have under the CCPA, and provides other notices to Californians required by other laws. The description of our data practices in Sections 1 and 2 of this Notice, as required by the CCPA, covers only calendar year 2020 and will be updated annually. Our practices in calendar year 2021 may change; however, if materially different such that we think a Consumer would reasonably expect notice we will provide pre-collection notice of the current practices, which may include reference to our general privacy policy or other applicable privacy policies and notices.</p><p>Consistent with the CCPA, job applicants, current and former employees and independent contractors (“<strong>Personnel</strong>”), and subjects of certain business-to-business communications acting solely in their capacity as representatives of another business, are not considered Consumers for purposes of this California Privacy Notice or the rights described herein. However, our Personnel may obtain a separate privacy notice that is applicable to them by contacting our Human Resources department. Publicly available information is also not treated as PI under the CCPA, so this notice is not intended to apply to that data and your Consumer privacy rights do not apply to that data.</p><p>To aid in readability, in some places we have abbreviated or summarized CCPA terms or language, but a full copy of the CCPA is available at Title 1.81.5 of the California Civil Code, Sections 1798.100 - .199. Terms defined in the CCPA that are used in this Notice with initial capitalizations shall have the same meaning as in the CCPA.</p><p>The CCPA is a new law and there remain differing interpretations of it and the regulations that implement it. Accordingly, we may from time-to-time update information in our notices regarding our data practices and your rights, modify our methods for you to make and for us to respond to your requests, and/or supplement our response(s) to your requests, as we continue to develop our compliance program to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of how it relates to our data practices.</p><p>You can click on the following links to navigate to the different sections in this Notice.</p>1. <a href="#PiWeCollect">PI We Collect </a><br><blockquote><p><span>(A) <a href="#SourcesOfPI">Sources of PI</a></span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>(B) <a href="#CollectionAndUseOfPI">Purposes</a></span></p></blockquote><span>2. <a href="#SharingOfPI">Sharing of PI</a></span><br><blockquote><p>(A) <a href="#Disclosures"></a>Disclosures for Business Purposes, at Your Direction and In Corporate Transactions and Intra-Company Transfers</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(B) <a href="#Sale"></a>Sale</p></blockquote><span>3. <a href="#CaliforniaPrivacyRights">California Privacy Rights</a></span> <br><blockquote><p>(A) <a href="#TheRightToKnow">The Right to Know</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>i.

There may be additional information that we collect that meets the CCPA’s definition of PI but is not reflected by a category, in which case we will treat it as PI as required by the CCPA, but will not include it when we are required to describe our practices by category of PI.<br> <br> As permitted by applicable law, we do not treat deidentified data or aggregate consumer information as PI and we reserve the right to convert, or permit others to convert, your PI into deidentified data or aggregate consumer information and may elect not to treat publicly available information as PI. We have no obligation to re-identify such information or keep it longer than we need it to respond to your requests. This helps us practice data minimization, which we consider to be a privacy best practice consistent with our mission to respect our customers. <br> <br> <a href="#top">Return to top</a></p><strong><a name="SourcesOfPI">A. Sources of PI</a></strong><br> <br> We may collect your PI directly from you or from service providers, such as internet listing services, fraud prevention and security providers, marketing providers, and consumer service and support providers, credit reporting agencies, our affiliates, or other individuals and businesses, as well as public sources of data such as government databases. <br> <br> <a href="#top">Return to top</a><br> <br> <strong><a name="CollectionAndUseOfPI">B.

For more specific detail on our disclosures of PI, see the next section Sharing of PI.<br> <br> We may collect, use and disclose the PI we collect for one or more of the following Business Purposes:<br><ul><li><strong>Processing Interactions and Transactions</strong></li><li><strong>Managing Interactions and Transactions</strong></li><li><strong>Performing Services</strong></li><li><strong>Research and Development</strong></li><li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong></li><li><strong>Security</strong></li><li><strong>Debugging </strong></li></ul><br> Additional Business Purposes include Sharing PI with Third Parties for other than a Sale or one of the foregoing Business Purposes as required or permitted by applicable law, such as to our vendors that perform services for us, to the government or private parties to comply with law or legal process, to the consumer or other parties at the consumer’s request, for the additional purposes explained in our Privacy Policy, and to assignees as part of a merger or asset sale, for auditing, data analytics, business process improvement, resident screening, and payment processing (“<strong>Other Business Purposes</strong>”).<br> <br> Subject to restrictions and obligations of the CCPA, our vendors may also use your PI for some or all of the above listed Business Purposes. Our vendors may themselves engage Service Providers or subcontractors to enable them to perform services for us, which sub-processing is, for purposes of certainty, an additional Other Business Purpose for which we are providing you notice.<br> <br> In addition, we may collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law.<br> <br> <a href="#top">Return to top</a><br> <br> <strong><a name="SharingOfPI">2.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</a></strong><br> <br><p>We provide California Consumers the privacy rights described in this section. You have the right to exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA and related regulations. As permitted by the CCPA, any Right to Know or Right to Delete request you submit to us is subject to an identity verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”). To protect consumer privacy we will not provide or delete PI unless you have provided sufficient information for us to verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. Please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/d3d181fc-d46b-4ee9-8be4-950247b14781/draft/3ea04bd7-7dc7-4886-b765-5f5bf29edc88.html" target="_blank">here</a> or call us at 1-833-605-4293 between the hours of 9 AM and 5 PM ET, Monday through Friday, and respond to any follow up inquires we may make. You may also obtain information on how to make a request by asking a manager at any of our communities.</p><p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPA’s verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA we do not include that PI in response to those requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create an account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request, but if you have an account we may require you to use it to be verified. We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p><p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.</p><p>Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you your social security number, driver’s license number or other government-issued id number, financial account number, any health or medical identification number, an account password, security questions or answers, or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics in response to a CCPA request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us.</p><p>Your California Consumer privacy rights are as follows:</p><strong><a name="TheRightToKnow">A. The Right to Know:</a></strong><br> <br><p><strong>i.

For any request using any of these methods, we will undertake to verify your request which will require that you provide us with additional data so that we may connect your identity to data that retain, as well as verify that the person making the request is the subject of that data. If we cannot verify you to a high degree of certainty we will not provide you your specific pieces of PI, but will automatically convert your request to a Categories request (explained below) and apply the less stringent Categories verification standard. If we cannot verify you to that standard, we will refer you to this Notice for general information on our data practices. This is required by the CCPA and designed to protect your privacy.</p><p>Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to fully respond to what might be relevant going back 12 months prior to the request.</p><p><strong>ii.

Third Party Marketing and Your California Privacy Rights:</strong></p><p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of PI to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p><p><strong>Separate from your CCPA “Do Not Sell” rights you have the following additional rights regarding disclosure of your information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes:</strong></p><p>We may from time to time elect to share certain “personal information” (as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law) about you with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us to, under certain circumstances, request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2021 will receive information about 2020 sharing activities).

Tracking and Targeting:</strong></p><p>When you visit our online services, we and third parties may use tracking technologies to collect usage information based on your device for a variety of purposes, including serving you advertising, based on your having visited our services or your activities across time and third-party locations. Some browsers may enable you to turn on or off a so-called “Do Not Track” signal.
