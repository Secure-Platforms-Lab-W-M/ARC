<ol><li><strong>Starbucks Mobile Applications</strong></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use of the Application entails information collection in accordance with the <strong>Information We Collect</strong> section above, and includes ways for you (the “User”) to control Application functionality, such as location services, purchasing e-gifts, and setting push notification and in-app message preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>User Information -</strong>Through the use of an iOS, Android or other supported hardware device, some functionality of the Application requires the transmission of certain information provided by you to Starbucks, including:</h2>

	<li>phone number;</li>

<p>This User Information is needed in order to purchase Starbucks products through the Application.&nbsp; You have multiple options to securely and conveniently make your purchase, including:</p>

<ul><li>by using the Application to pay in the same manner as you would pay with a Starbucks Card (“Mobile Payment”);</li>
	<li>by making payment via your mobile device using a Starbucks Card prior to arriving at the store (“Method of Payment,” or “MOP”); and</li>
	<li>by placing an order using voice commands (“Voice Ordering”).</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As described further below, certain optional information is also shared with Starbucks through the Application, including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Personalized messages for individuals to whom you would like to purchase and send a Starbucks gift card (“eGift”), and names and email addresses from a device’s “contacts” list if you choose to import a recipient’s contact information from there;</li>
	<li>advanced analytics information such as location data, diagnostic and usage data, and user interactions;</li>
	<li>location-based information, such as through GPS, Bluetooth-enabled iBeacons, or other location-based technology to enhance the user experience so that you may order ahead, receive directions, and see what is available at nearby stores; and</li>
	<li>the day and month of your birthday, so that we may recognize you on your special day (we don’t ask for your birth year for this).</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To enable our systems to recognize your browser or device and to provide the Application to you, we use cookies. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our <a href="https://www.starbucks.ie/cookienotice" rel="noreferrer nofollow">[Cookies Notice]</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><br><strong>Controlling Application Functionality</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Location&nbsp; Services</strong><strong> - </strong>In order to use certain Application functionality, such as MOP and location-based services and technology, you must either (a) enable “location services” in the Application; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information. More information about adjusting location services on iOS devices may be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207092" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;, and additional information on managing an Android device’s location settings may be found <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you allow for location sharing, your device communicates with us in ways that allow for us to customize your experience in and around Starbucks stores, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to tailor messages based on your time and location patterns, and to limit the number of times you see a promotional message or offer.</p>

<p><strong>Voice Ordering</strong><strong> -</strong> In order to use certain Application functionality such as Voice Ordering, when available, you must (a) enable “microphone” and “speech recognition” in the Application; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information.</p>

<p>If you use such Application functionality, including location services and voice ordering, you are transmitting User Information to Starbucks and/or its agents, and authorize Starbucks and/or its agents, to record, process, and store such User Information as necessary for the Application functionality and for purposes described in the Starbucks Privacy Statement. Please see the rest of this Privacy Statement for more information about how we may use and store personal information, and how to control the use of your personal information.<br><br><strong>eGifts</strong><strong> -</strong>&nbsp; If you choose to use Application functionality that allows you to send messages or eGifts to third parties, you must first obtain their permission to provide their personal information, such as their name, phone number or email address, to Starbucks. The referred information will be used by Starbucks for the purpose of contacting the third party, on your behalf, to carry out the requested functionality, for example, by emailing an eGift. Although you may enter the recipient’s contact information into the Application, you also have the option to provide the recipient’s contact information by granting Starbucks permission to access your device’s contacts.<br><br><strong>User Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>You are solely responsible for maintenance of the confidentiality and security of any User Information which you transmit from or store on a Device for purposes of the Application, including Mobile Payment, MOP and Voice Ordering, and for all transactions and other activities undertaken with any Starbucks Card registered in the your name, whether authorized or unauthorized. You agree to immediately notify Starbucks of any unauthorized transactions associated with the Application including Mobile Payment, MOP, Voice Ordering, or any other breach of security. Starbucks shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the loss or theft of User Information which you transmit from or store on a Device or from unauthorized or fraudulent transactions associated with the Application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Email Communications, Push Notifications, and In-App Messages</strong></h2>

<p>The Application allows all users to set preferences for receiving promotional email communications from Starbucks, receiving push notifications on your device, and receiving inbox messages.&nbsp; Please note as well that you may opt-out of receiving email communications at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings as described in the <strong>Your Choices and Rights </strong>section below, or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any commercial email we send you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li><strong><a rel="nofollow">Your Choices</a> and Rights</strong></li>
</ol><p>You have control over your promotional communications preferences, mobile application functionality, cookie settings, and interest-based advertising preferences. You also have certain rights under law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more information on our use of cookies, please read our see [<a href="https://www.starbucks.ie/cookienotice" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cookies Notice</a>].</p>

<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>

<p><strong>Request access&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Request correction&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>of the personal information that we hold about you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Request erasure&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information in certain circumstances (e.g., where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Object to processing&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Request the restriction of processing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Request the transfer&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>of your personal information to another party, when possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can exercise these rights by visiting your user account at<em> </em><a href="http://www.starbucks.ie/account" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>www.starbucks.ie/account</em></a><em> </em>&nbsp;or by contacting us as described in the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.starbucks.ie/contact-us" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Contact Us"</a></strong> section below and specifying which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise.&nbsp; We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within one month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>How We Protect Your Information</u></strong></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We protect your information using technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. When you transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through our website or in one of our mobile applications, we encrypt the transmission of that information using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

<p>However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including personal information, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Retention and Disposal of Your Information</strong></li>
</ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We store personal information as needed to accomplish the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.&nbsp; Our retention of your personal information is governed by applicable law.&nbsp; This storage period may extend beyond the term of your relationship with us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law. We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations. When personal information is no longer needed, or in any event, after legal authority to retain it has expired, personal information will be destroyed, in accordance with local law and pursuant to procedures established in relation to the relevant system or process.</p>

<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Starbucks or for our third-party service providers. In such cases, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection of the recipient as required under the GDPR, including by putting in place standard contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission. You may obtain a copy of these clauses by contacting our DPO (see the Contact Us section below).&nbsp;</p>
