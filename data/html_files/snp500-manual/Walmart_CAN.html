        <h2>How do we secure your personal information?</h2>
    

    

    
        <p>Walmart is committed to keeping your personal information secure. Whether you are shopping online, on our apps or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to protect your personal information.</p><p>Walmart designs its products, services, and systems with privacy and security in mind, and we employ numerous professionals whose sole mission is to ensure data integrity and security. Dedicated information security teams ensure appropriate technical and organizational information security measures are applied to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss or use during transit and at rest.</p><p>Walmart associates are accountable for the protection of  personal information under their control and must take appropriate measures to prevent loss, damage, abuse or unauthorized access to such information. We ensure that each team member with access to personal information completes privacy and information security training to equip them with knowledge and skills to properly protect the data under their control.</p><p>Your information is usually stored in Canada, but we may use suppliers or partners located outside of the country. For example, some of our computer systems, including our websites, are operated by our parent company, Walmart Inc., in the United States or by other companies contracted to provide services to Walmart that operate in other jurisdictions. </p><p>Because the law in some of these countries may not provide the same level of protection as Canadian law, we put in place information management agreements with each company that processes personal information for Walmart. These agreements require that, wherever your personal information is held or processed, it is protected to the same high standard as required by law in Canada.</p><p>Please be aware that no security measures can guarantee complete security. You should also take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login credentials private.

        <p>We keep your personal information for only as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, after which we delete or anonymize your personal information. Once your personal information is anonymized or deleted, your email is removed from our distribution lists and, except for any information that we require to retain for accounting or legal purposes (including to manage any potential chargebacks), your account is no longer accessible or viewable.</p>
