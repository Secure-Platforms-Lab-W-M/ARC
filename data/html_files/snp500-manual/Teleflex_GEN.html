										<h3>3. Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
										<p>
											When browsing the Sites, our servers collect certain information, such as
											your IP address, domain name, browser type, pages viewed and the time you
											visited our Sites, the number of times you return to our Sites and other
											click-stream data. This information may be compiled and/or analyzed by us on
											an aggregated basis to measure our users’ habits. This helps us to measure
											the use of our Sites, improve the content, functionality and operation of
											our Sites and to better understand and serve our users.
										</p>
										<p>
											Cookies are small data files that are created by your computer’s browser and
											stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a particular website. We
											may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to
											otherwise specifically tailor your experience on our Sites.
										</p>
										<p>
											Depending on your location, we may ask for your consent to our use of any
											non-necessary cookies (see descriptions of cookie types below) by way of a
											pop-up banner when you first land on our website. You can choose to either
											accept or reject non-necessary cookies as you prefer.
										</p>
										<p>
											Otherwise, you can also set your browser to notify you when you receive a
											cookie and decide if you want to accept it or not. Most browsers accept
											cookies automatically, but they can be set up to ask for your prior consent
											before an individual cookie is set on your device. This will give you
											control over your cookies; however, it may interfere with your browsing
											experience as some websites may not function properly and you may not be
											able to take advantage of all the features offered by our Sites. If cookies
											are blocked, certain tasks or features of our Sites may not be functional.
										</p>
										<p>
											For instructions on blocking and deleting cookies, see the privacy and help
											documentation of your specific browser’s website. If you use multiple
											devices and/or browsers, you will need to disable cookies on each device and
											on each browser separately.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you limit the ability of our Sites to set cookies, this may prevent you
											from using certain features of our Sites properly and your user experience –
											which will no longer be personalized for you – may deteriorate. You may also
											be able to opt-out from certain cookies through third party cookie
											management sites. Disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain parts
											of our Site.
										</p>
										<p>
											Session cookies are used to store temporary data in memory which exists only
											for the duration of the user’s session. All information from them is removed
											completely whenever the session is finished. They are generally used to pass
											information from one Site to another. Teleflex uses session cookies to
											maintain an internal session identifier required by the underlying web
											technology, and to provide Site usage statistics.

											Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function
											to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard
											drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs
											(a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site
											to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us
											manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third
											party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our
											customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails
											are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
										</p>
										<p>
											Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You
											may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g.,
											by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by
											following the instructions below.
										</p>
										<p>
											We may use third party services such as Google Analytics to evaluate usage
											of our Site and our services. We also may use other analytic means to
											evaluate our Site and services. We use these tools to help us improve our
											Site’s and services’ performance and user experiences. These entities may
											use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local
											storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services in accordance with their
											own privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please
											review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy.
											You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent

										<p>
											Cross Device and Browser Use. We and our third party service providers may
											use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from you
											from our website, through your device(s), or from a third party) to help us
											and our third party service providers identify other devices that you use
											(e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer). We, and our third party
											service providers, also may use the cross-device and browser tracking and
											other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your
											devices and to send you emails. To opt-out of cross-device and browser
											advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth below. Please note:
											if you opt out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be
											specific to the web browser or mobile device from which you accessed the
											opt-out. If you use multiple devices or browsers, you will need to opt out
											of each browser or device that you use.
										</p>
										<p>
											We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on
											our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking
											platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements
											to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
											Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
											measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including
											clear GIFs), and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of
											their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party
