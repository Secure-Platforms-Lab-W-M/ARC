<p>Revised: January 1, 2023</p>

<p>Conagra Brands, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “Conagra Brands” or “we”) offer a wide variety of food products through our iconic <a href="https://www.conagrabrands.com/brands" target="_blank">brands</a> (each a “Brand”). We recognize that those who visit our websites are concerned about how personal information they provide online is maintained and used by Conagra Brands. To address these concerns, this policy describes our online information practices and the choices that you can make about the collection and use of your information.</p>

<p><strong>This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="/">www.conagrabrands.com</a> and Conagra Brands’ and other Brand websites, services, applications and products that display these terms (collectively, our “sites”). The Privacy Policy also applies to the sites of all subsidiaries and affiliates of Conagra Brands unless otherwise noted on any particular site. By using the sites, you acknowledge and accept the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy. </strong></p>

<p>From time to time, we may change our privacy policies. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our site or sending you a notification or providing you other notice to the extent required by law). Please check our sites periodically for updates and to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, please review our <a href="/state-specific-privacy-notice">State Specific Privacy Notice and Notice at Collection.</a></p>

<h2><strong>We collect information from and about you.</strong></h2>

<p>The information we collect from you varies depending on how you use our sites and the products and services offered on our sites. The types of personal information you may provide us or that we collect about you include:</p>

<p><strong>Other information.</strong> We collect information about your device, such as device-specific identifiers, IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, mobile network information, and device settings. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us, what links you click on, or what pages you view.</p>

<h2><strong>We collect information in different ways. </strong></h2>

<p><strong>We collect information directly from you.</strong> For example, if you purchase a product, sign up for a newsletter, or enter a promotion. We also collect information if you fill out an online survey.</p>

<p><strong>We collect information from you automatically.</strong> We use tracking tools like browser cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to help personalize, improve, and provide our services, including allowing you to be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. To control these tools, read the “choices” section below.</p>

<p><strong>We collect information about you from third parties.</strong> For example, our business partners may give us information about you. Social media platforms may also give us information about you. We may also get information from other sources, such as public databases, data aggregators or other commercially available sources.</p>

<h2><strong>We use information as disclosed and described here.</strong></h2>

<p><strong>We use information to provide the sites and our services.</strong> We use the information we collect and receive to provide you with the products, services, or information that you request; to provide you with information about the sites or required notices; and to customize your experience when using the sites, among other things.</p>

<p><strong>We use information to respond to your requests or questions.</strong> For example, we might use your information to respond to your customer feedback. We may also use your information to notify you if you win a contest or sweepstakes. We might also send you emails or newsletters you request. We may use your friend’s email address if you send a friend an email through our site.</p>

We might use your information to track your behavior across multiple platforms or devices. We might use your information to customize your experience with us. We also might use content you post or share to get you to more actively engage with us. We may combine the information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties.</p>

<p><strong>We use information for security purposes.</strong> We may use information to protect our company, our customers, our sites, and others.</p>

<p><strong>We use information as otherwise permitted by law.</strong></p>

<h2>We may share your information.</h2>

<p><strong>We will share information within the Conagra Brands family of companies.</strong> This also includes future subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>

<p><strong>We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.</strong> For example, we share information with vendors who send emails for us. We may also share information with service providers that operate or host our sites, provide data storage, or administer activities on our behalf, such as promotion administration. In addition, we share your information with third parties who help us operate our business including those that process payments on our behalf and manage our payment gateway. These parties are bound to handle your information securely and only process the information they need to perform the services we request.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the sites. Google Analytics provides information about how many users visit our sites, when they may visit, and how they navigate the sites once they are on them. We may also use other Google Analytics tools, such a Demographics and Interest Reporting, which enables us to learn more about the characteristics and interests of the users who visit our sites. For information about how Google uses the information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can opt out of Google Analytics by visiting <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information with Ad Networks. </strong>We may have relationships with third party service providers known as Ad Networks to serve ads on our behalf across the internet. Using tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons, Ad Networks collect anonymous information about your visits to our sites and other websites in order to deliver advertisements that may be of particular interest to you. To control these tools, read the “choices” section below.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information with promotional partners.</strong> From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Conagra Brands for joint promotions. We may share information with these promotional partners (and their service providers) as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless we first get your consent to such sharing.</p>

<p><strong>We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.</strong> For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.</strong> For example, if we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, a business reorganization, or similar event, we may transfer your information as part of such transaction.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information that is posted on public forums or reviews.</strong> Any information, such as reviews, that you may disclose on our sites, in blogs, on message boards, or on other public areas on our sites, becomes public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. Conagra Brands cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law or your personal privacy and safety, and is not responsible for the results of such postings.</p>

<p><strong>We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you at the point of collection or prior to such sharing or with your consent or pursuant to your direction.</strong> We may share information that is not reasonably identified with you for any purpose.</p>

<h2><strong>You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Information for Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”)</strong></h2>

<p>Our sites are not directed to and we do not directly offer goods or services via those sites to EEA residents, including residents in the European Union (EU) or to residents in the United Kingdom (UK).

To the extent required, this section provides additional information applicable to EEA and UK Personal Data, which may not apply to users in other geographies.</p>

		<li>To process a job application; or</li>
		<li>To fulfill any other agreements between us.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation, for example to meet our tax and accounting obligations.</li>
	<li>Necessary to serve the legitimate business interests of Conagra Brands or a third party, where such use is consistent with the fundamental rights of individuals under European law, for example:
	<ul><li>To provide you with effective customer service or technical support, such as where you have requested information from Conagra Brands;</li>
		<li>To contact you with information regarding health and safety, applicable regulations, or stewardship of our products;</li>
		<li>To improve the content, functionality, performance, security, and usability of our sites;</li>
		<li>To notify you about changes to our business, products, services, or sites; or</li>
		<li>To conduct business transactions, including purchases and sales of Conagra Brands’ products, or business reorganizations including the sale, transfer, change in control, or merger of Conagra Brands assets or businesses.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Subject to valid consent you have freely provided and not withdrawn, such as opt-in consents allowing Conagra Brands to place cookies on your computer or to use your contact information for promotional advertising.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Data Subject Rights:</strong> EEA and UK residents who may use this site have the legal right to request Conagra Brands undertake specific actions with respect to their Personal Data, including:</p>

<ul><li>The right to request access to your Personal Data, including the right to have Conagra Brands confirm if your Personal Data is being used by Conagra Brands;</li>
	<li>The right to have your Personal Data corrected or erased;</li>
	<li>The right to object to or restrict Conagra Brands’ use of your Personal Data, for example where such information is not accurate or no longer needed;</li>

	<li>The right to not be subject to automated decision-making or profiling based on your Personal Data;</li>
	<li>The right to withdraw any consent you have previously provided to Conagra Brands’ collection or use of your Personal Data; and</li>
	<li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Cross-Border Transfers of Data:</strong> The information that Conagra Brands collects from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA and UK. It may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA and UK who work for us, or by other entities acting as data processors on our behalf.

You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us through the contact information listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Conagra Brands will process and store your Personal Data for the duration of our relationship with you, which may be long term, and as long as necessary to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations. Conagra Brands will delete your data:</p>

<ul><li>When it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which that information was collected and processed;</li>
	<li>Upon your request or objection, provided there are no overriding legal grounds requiring Conagra Brands to maintain that information;</li>
	<li>When necessary to comply with Conagra Brands’ legal obligations; or</li>
	<li>If our collection of information was based on your consent, upon the withdrawal of your consent.</li>
