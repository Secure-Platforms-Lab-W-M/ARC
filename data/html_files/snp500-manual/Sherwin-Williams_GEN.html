<h2><strong><a name="cookies-web-beacons" href=""></a>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Internet Technologies</strong></h2>

<p>We, as well as certain third parties, including those that provide content and other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixels, web beacons and other similar technologies on our online Services and the information collected from such technologies. By using our online Services, you are consenting to our use of tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>

<p>A cookie is a small file that may be stored on your computer or other device. A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites and services.</p>

<p>When you use a web browser to access the Services, you may configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Click the “Help” menu of your browser to learn more about how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies. Please note that disabling cookies may affect your ability to access and use certain features of the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</strong></h3>

<p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates. There is no industry standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Sherwin-Williams currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established and accepted, Sherwin-Williams may revisit its policy on responding to these signals. If you are a U.S. user, <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track">click here</a> for information about Do-Not-Track signals and similar mechanisms.</p>

<h3><strong>Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels </strong></h3>

<p>Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels) and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties. We may use web beacons, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Technologies</strong></h3>

<p>There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use “SDKs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices. SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile application by third party companies with which we work. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile application and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access our application, such as the advertising identifier associated with your device and information about how you interact with our application.</p>

<h3><strong>How We Use These Technologies</strong></h3>

<p>We do not use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA.</p>

<p>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

<p>We keep the categories of PI described above for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or otherwise authorized by law. This generally means holding the information for as long as one of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your PI is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information;</li>
	<li>Your PI is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which the PI was collected;</li>
	<li>The information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property (which will generally relate to applicable laws that limit actions in a particular case); or</li>
	<li>We are otherwise required or permitted to keep your information by applicable laws or regulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where PI is used for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires. For more information about our retention policies, please contact us using the contact details below.</p>

<p>SELLING AND SHARING OF CALIFORNIA PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

<p>The categories of Consumer and B2B PI that we disclose for a business or commercial purpose and the categories of recipients are listed in the chart at the beginning of this California Privacy Notice. The chart below summarizes the categories of PI we sell or share with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. Although we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for money, some of the ways in which we share PI for advertising or marketing may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the PI of California residents under 16 years of age.</p>

<h3 align="left"><u>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</u></h3>

<p>Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights they may exercise either independently or through an authorized agent.</p>

<p>Your California privacy rights are described below. To make a request to delete, request to correct, or request to know, you can submit a case through our on-line <a href="https://sherwinwilliams.ethicspointvp.com/custom/sherwinwilliams/web/en/dp/form_data.asp?SourceName=test&amp;SourceURL=">Global Privacy Portal</a> or by calling 1-844-835-4134. Please follow the instructions on our <a href="https://sherwinwilliams.ethicspointvp.com/custom/sherwinwilliams/web/en/dp/form_data.asp?SourceName=test&amp;SourceURL=">Global Privacy Portal</a> and promptly respond to any follow-up inquires so that we may confirm your identity.&nbsp;If you would like to opt out of the sales and sharing of PI, click the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on the homepage of the Sherwin-Williams website(s) you visited and move the Targeting Cookies toggle to “off”.</p>

<p>If you submit a request to know, request to delete or request to correct, you will be asked to log into your account or to provide 2-3 pieces of PI that we will match against our records to verify your identity. Authorized Agents may submit requests on behalf of Consumers by following these steps and providing appropriate documentation. If you submit a request through an authorized agent, you will still need to verify your identity directly with us before your request can be processed.</p>

<p><strong><u>Right to Know</u></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we disclose the following information for the 12-month period prior to the request date. Consumer requests of this nature may be made no more than twice in a 12-month period.</p>

<ol>
	<li>(1) The categories of PI we have collected about you, including:
	<ul>
		<li>a. The categories of sources from which the PI was collected</li>
		<li>b. Our business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing PI</li>
		<li>c. The categories of third parties to which we disclose PI</li>

		<li>e. The categories of PI that we disclosed for a business purpose, and for each category identified, the categories of recipients to which we disclosed that particular category of PI</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><u>Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of PI</u></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your PI, and to request that we do not share your PI for cross-context behavioral advertising. Although we do not sell Personal Information in exchange for money, some of the ways in which we share PI for advertising or marketing may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CCPA.&nbsp;If you would like to opt out of the sales and sharing of PI, click the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on the homepage of the Sherwin-Williams website(s) you visited and move the Targeting Cookies toggle to “off”.</p>

<p><strong><u>Deletion Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you. Under the CCPA, we may decline to delete your PI under certain circumstances—for example, if we need the PI to complete transactions or provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, to comply with law, or to exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

<p><strong><u>Correction Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>If you believe that PI we maintain about you is inaccurate, you have the right to request that we correct that information.</p>

<p><strong><u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights </u></strong></p>

<p>If you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights under the CCPA, you also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE</strong></p>

<p>Our PaintPerks rewards program provides benefits such as rewards points and discounts to those who choose to participate. Participation requires you to provide some PI, such as Identifiers, Customer Records, and Commercial Information. The incentives associated with our rewards program are designed to reward loyal customers based on the volume of products and services they purchase from us. For the full terms and conditions applicable to our rewards program, please click <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/paint-perks/terms">here.</a></p>

<p>We have made a good faith estimate that the value of PI provided in connection with our rewards program is equivalent to the relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of that PI. Any difference in price or benefits provided to customers who participate in our rewards program is reasonably related to the value of the PI provided. By joining our rewards program, you consent to any financial incentive associated with the program. You have the right to withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by cancelling your participation in the rewards program. To cancel your rewards membership, please click <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/homeowners/special-offers/preferred-customer">here</a>. Please note that if you submit a request to delete, that will delete PI associated with any rewards account you may have.</p>
