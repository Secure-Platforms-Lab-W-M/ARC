A "web beacon" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or apps to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server.</p><p>We may combine information received from the Data Technologies about visitors to our website or use this information to enable certain features of our services. This information may include demographic data, technical information about the technology (<em>e.g.</em>, phone, computer) you use to connect to the online services, web browser information, your IP address, geolocation of your mobile device, and browsing behavior such as pages visited and how often they are visited.</p><p>We allow service providers and third-party companies to use Data Technologies to collect the information described above and to track browsing activity over time and across third-party websites, such as web browsers used, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our online services, to support data analytics or, in some instances, to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third-party technologies, and their use of such technologies is governed by their own privacy policies. &nbsp;For example, we use certain products from Google for analytics and advertising purposes.&nbsp; You can learn more about Google’s privacy practices with respect to analytics and advertising services by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US">here</a>.</p><p>The types of cookies on our websites fall into any one of the following categories:</p><ul><li>“Strictly Necessary” cookies are necessary for the website or application to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.</li><li>“Functional” cookies enable the website or application to provide enhanced functionality and personalization based on your interaction with the website or application.&nbsp; These cookies also allow us to track analytics by counting visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our websites and applications. They may be set by us or by service providers (e.g. Google) to help us to know which pages or content are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website or application.&nbsp;</li><li>“Advertising” cookies may be set by us or through our websites and applications by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other websites.&nbsp; You may disable these types of cookies.&nbsp; Only some of our websites and applications utilize Advertising cookies.&nbsp; For those that do, you will be given the option to opt-out of the placement of this type of cookie on your device.&nbsp; Refer to the section of this Notice titled “Your Targeted Advertising Options”.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The length of time cookies will stay on your device will depend on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiration date, unless deleted by you before the expiration date. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of your web session, when the web browser is closed.<br></p>                  </div>
