<h4>WHEN THE PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>The Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect when you subscribe to, access, or use the Spectrum products, services, websites and applications (sometimes referred to as the "Spectrum Platform" in this Privacy Policy).</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the portions of the Spectrum Platform you access, use, or to which you subscribe, parts of this Privacy Policy may not apply to you. To help clarify some of our more general statements, we provide real-world examples throughout the Privacy Policy of how we collect and use information. These are only examples and may not cover every situation. If you have questions, please contact us directly using the information in the “How to Contact Us With Questions About This Privacy Policy” section below.</span></p>
<p><span>Some Spectrum products and services may have additional privacy practices that are described in product- or service-specific sections in this Privacy Policy or may be provided to you in different ways, such as our commercial agreements for Spectrum Enterprise services. To the extent there is an overlap between the privacy disclosures in this Privacy Policy and a product- or service-specific privacy notice (e.g., the Spectrum Biometric Data Privacy Notice), the privacy disclosures set forth in the product or service-specific notice or commercial agreement will apply and control with respect to such product or service.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes you may access websites (e.g., news websites, shopping websites, internet search engine, etc.) or services (e.g., non-Spectrum email and instant messaging services or video streaming services, gaming services, data storage services, etc.) that we do not own or control through the Spectrum Platform. We urge our customers to be careful and aware of the privacy practices of these third parties, because this Privacy Policy does not extend to parties that collect information outside of our control and does not cover information that third parties may collect:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>when you download applications or make purchases from other companies while using our Spectrum Internet or Spectrum Mobile services;</span></li>
<li><span>when you log into video services and access video content provided by a third party with your Spectrum services or through your Spectrum-issued device;</span></li>
<li><span>through any other third-party product, service, website, or application, including your interactions with online video and third-party content services, even if you access them through the Spectrum Platform; and</span></li>
<li><span>through devices sold to you by Spectrum or another provider (e.g., when you purchase an iPhone through Spectrum or bring your own device)&nbsp; that enables you to access the Spectrum Platform, or through a smart television where the manufacturer has directly enabled information gathering capabilities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other products, services, websites, applications and devices to understand their privacy practices; those privacy policies will apply to those third parties' collection of your information, even if access to such content or use of such products or devices requires you to be a Spectrum subscriber. For example, some of the premium streaming services available online that require you to authenticate your subscription using your Spectrum username and password may be governed by their own privacy policies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>In order to provide you with our products and services, we collect a variety of information about you when you interact with us or use our products, services, websites and applications. This information enables us to provide our services to you on a cost-effective basis and to tailor our products and services to best meet your needs and interests. For example, in order to provide timely and effective customer service, we gather information regarding when you called, the reason for the call, and what is the best way to get in contact with you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a Spectrum customer and you allow others to access and/or use your accounts, we will collect information about those users’ interactions with us and the Spectrum Platform, as well. We may also collect information about you from third parties, such as demographic and personal interest information.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Information You Provide to Us Directly or When You Create an Account</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We collect information you provide to us when you establish a customer or user account, register to use and/or connect to certain of our services (e.g., Spectrum WiFi), and when you contact us or otherwise communicate with us, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, and phone number);</span></li>
<li><span>usernames, passwords, images (e.g., driver’s license photo), biometric data (e.g., voiceprints), and other authenticating information associated with a Spectrum account;</span></li>
<li><span>information about the types of services to which you subscribe, orders you place or downloads you make through the Spectrum Platform, the service options you have chosen, and any customized setting you have created;</span></li>
<li><span>information about your payment methods, such as your payment card number or bank account information;</span></li>
<li><span>information related to a credit application for a product or service or to protect against fraud, which may include your Social Security number, driver's license number, or other government issued identifier;</span></li>
<li><span>information you provide when you enter contests or respond to customer surveys, or participate in or attend events sponsored by us; and</span></li>
<li><span>information we keep in our records when you correspond or otherwise communicate with us, including through our call centers, in-person, online chat sessions, and through social media.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Spectrum is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, and any use of biometric data is voluntary and requires the customer’s express permission. For more information about how we define biometric data, the type of biometric data collected, the limited use and sharing of that information, and associated storage and retention practices, please review our Spectrum Biometric Data Privacy Notice by </span><span>clicking&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/biometric-data-privacy"><span>here</span></a><span>&nbsp;or by visiting our Your Privacy Rights section on our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/your-privacy-rights"><span>website</span></a><span>.</span><br><br>&nbsp;<span><strong>Information We Collect Automatically and Through Your Use of the Spectrum Platform&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>We automatically collect information about your use of the Spectrum Platform in order to deliver any of our services or otherwise permit access to one of our products, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>information from any device you use when you interact with us, including but not limited to the device identifiers, the number, types, and status of devices connected to our network, network addresses, operating system, and technical configurations of the equipment used with our services, products, websites and applications;</li>
<li>network traffic data;</li>
<li>performance and support data; and</li>
<li>information about your use and the operation of the Spectrum Platform and its features.</li>
</ul>
<p>We automatically collect usage information to provide you with our products and services. The information we collect will depend upon the Spectrum services to which you subscribe, access, or interact. We limit the use and sharing of such information as described in this Privacy Policy and as required by law. For example, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>usage information about the channels, programs, and advertisements to which your device was tuned when you subscribe to our video service in order to provide you video content ("Video Usage Information");</li>
<li>usage information about the websites you visit when you are using the Spectrum Internet, Mobile or WiFi services, in order to provide the service and connect you to the other sites and services you request, and WiFi usage data, such as the amount of data used, device identifiers, and quality of service (i.e., quality of the signal) from customers who use our company-issued routers as part of our provision of Spectrum Internet service (collectively, "Internet Usage Information"); and</li>
<li>call records, including the phone numbers that you call and that call you, and the times and dates of those calls, the number of text messages sent and received, when you subscribe to our phone and/or mobile service ("Call Detail Information").</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you subscribe to or use services that require us to transfer or store communications such as a Spectrum email account or a Spectrum voice product that includes a voicemail service, it will be necessary for us to collect the content of those communications to provide you with the service you have requested because it is required in order for the services to function. Additionally, we collect the content of any files you store in our cloud storage services (e.g., Spectrum Cloud DVR) and other information when it is necessary to provide you with the products or features of the services you use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit or use Spectrum websites and mobile applications, we collect information about your interactions within those website or applications, including where you browse, what you search, and any purchases you make within them. We also collect device information, including your IP address and information about your browser, operating system, and platform type; demographic information through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies; and information about the website that referred you to a Spectrum website, and the website to which we refer you when you leave a Spectrum website. The collection of this information, including IP addresses and the referring websites, is required in order for us to provide internet service, for users to communicate with each other and with websites and other services on the internet, and/or for network management and/or security and integrity purposes. Please refer to the Spectrum Internet DNS Privacy Notice, available by visiting our Your Privacy Rights section on our <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/your-privacy-rights">website</a>, to learn more about the type of Domain Name System (“DNS”) data we collect based on our provision of Spectrum Internet service, how we use and share that information, and our storage and retention practices associated with the DNS data we maintain.</p>
<p><span><strong>Location Information</strong></span></p>
<p>When you access our network, we may collect general location information, such as the city or zip code that correlates with the license of your device IP address, or more precise geolocation data that indicates where you are at a specific point in time. We may also collect location information when you use some of our services and applications, including precise geolocation information, such as your service address and the location of your Spectrum Mobile device or another device on which you have installed a Spectrum application. For example, when a Spectrum Mobile device connects using an in-home or out-of-home Spectrum WiFi access point, we collect the device’s MAC address, the customer’s username (if the customer is logged into the My Spectrum App), which is encrypted, and the Spectrum WiFi access point’s geographical location. If the customer has opted out of device location services, no device geolocation information is shared with us. If the customer has opted in to enable location services for Spectrum apps, like the My Spectrum App or Spectrum TV App, the device communicates geolocation information to us to allow for troubleshooting in the event of a service issue, and to assist in efficiently managing and optimizing network performance.</p>
<p>When you first visit or use any Spectrum application that collects precise geolocation information, we will request permission to collect and use such information. You can prohibit the collection of this information through your device's settings&nbsp;<span>(see "</span><span> </span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"><span>Your Choices</span></a><span>") but it may limit certain functions and features of the application.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Information Obtained from Third Parties</strong></span></p>
<p>We may collect information from third parties for purposes related to delivering our products and services to you, for analytics and research, or for marketing and advertising our own products and services, as well as for delivering third-party advertising on the Spectrum Platform..&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes information to verify data you have provided and from credit reporting agencies to determine your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage. If you rent your residence, we may have a record of whether landlord permission was required prior to installing our cable facilities as well as your landlord's name and address.</p>
<p>We also receive information from content providers and other platform providers when you use your Spectrum account to authenticate your use of Spectrum services through that provider's platform or device. For example, a Spectrum subscriber to HBO will have access to the HBOMax app on their mobile device. When using that app, the Spectrum subscriber will be required to provide their Spectrum user information to HBO, which then provides that information to Spectrum to confirm that the HBOMax user is a subscriber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also obtain additional information from third parties , such as research consultants, marketing firms, data quality management solution firms, and programming partners to enhance or marketing and advertising programs. We may collect commercially available demographic information about you or your community available from third parties, such as age, gender, and preferred language. We may also collect personal interest data, such as whether you like to travel or are a sports enthusiast, to help us construct audience segments, deliver advertising, and evaluate the effectiveness of a given advertising campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>HOW AND WHEN WE USE INFORMATION (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p>First and foremost, we use the information we collect to provide you with reliable, high quality products and services. We also use the information we collect to communicate with you, make improvements to our products and services, investigate theft and other illegal activities, troubleshoot service issues, manage and optimize network performance, protect the privacy, security, and preferences of our customers, and personalize your experience. This may involve linking and combining information about you from across the Spectrum Platform, as well as from third parties ("Combined Information").</p>
<p>We also use the information we collect to measure and analyze how our customers are using our products, services, websites and applications. For example, when you subscribe to our video service, we use Video Usage Information to assess which programs are most popular, what programming and video content we will carry on the Services, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether people are watching advertisements. We may also use this information to understand how our customers prefer to view certain kinds of programming when they use our video service, such as whether they like to watch certain programs live, or if they prefer to view them on demand, on mobile devices, or online. This information helps us provide our customers with the most innovative services with the most value.</p>
<p>We may also use the information we collect to create business and marketing reports, show you more relevant advertising, and to report on advertising attribution, impressions, reach and frequency, whether through our own services and websites, or on third-party services and websites. <span>Please go to the "</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"> <span>Your Choices</span></a><span>" section of this Privacy Policy to better understand your choices with respect to how we use your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To Provide and Improve our Services, Products and Devices, Websites and Applications</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We use the information we collect to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>deliver, maintain and improve our products, services, websites and applications;</span></li>
<li><span>fulfill requests for new service or changes to your account or the products and services you already receive;</span></li>
<li><span>provide you with technical support and high quality customer service, including through the use of recorded or monitored communications between you and our customer service agents;</span></li>
<li><span>create and administer a Spectrum account, including activating your service, billing, invoicing, and debt collection activities;</span></li>
<li><span>authenticate or otherwise provide you access to your Spectrum products and services;</span></li>
<li><span>provide updates, upgrades, repairs or replacements for any of our service-related devices or software used in providing or receiving services;</span></li>
<li><span>manage and configure our device(s), system(s) and network(s);</span></li>
<li><span>understand how the service is being used, including through the creation of operational and marketing reports based on de-identified and/or aggregated service usage information;</span></li>
<li><span>inform you of additional products and services that may be of interest to you;</span></li>
<li><span>protect the security of the system, prevent fraud, detect unauthorized reception, use, and abuse of any Spectrum product, service, website or application, and to enforce any Spectrum policy or applicable terms of service;</span></li>
<li><span>protect our rights, our personnel, our property, and the safety of others;</span></li>
<li><span>maintain our accounting, tax and other records; and</span></li>
<li><span>comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as for the general administration of our business.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>To Communicate With You</strong></span></p>
<p>We use the information we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, if you use an interactive or transactional service, e.g., responding to a survey or ordering a pay-per-view event, we will use that information and information from your account to send you billing information, as well as recommendations for additional Spectrum products or services that may be of interest to you and to provide you with a more personalized experience. We may use the information to remind you of a service appointment, to follow up with you after a service request, and to send you important service-related notices and announcements. If you visit our website, we may send you reminders about items left in your online shopping cart.</p>
<p>We may send you promotional communications for products and services that may be of interest to you through the mail, over our cable system, by phone or SMS, or online. Some of these communications may be directed to you because of the Spectrum services to which you subscribe or your interactions on the Spectrum Platform, and some may be directed to you because of your general geographic location. For example, if we are launching a new service in limited areas, only residents of that particular area will receive that promotional communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>To Create Business and Marketing Reports</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We use the information we collect to create business and marketing reports (the "Reports") to provide insights into what products and services our customers are using, how long they are using our products and services, how some of our services are accessed, and what additional products and services may be of interest to our customers. In the video context, for example, these Reports contain information such as channel tuning, the time a channel is changed, when a Spectrum set-top box is "on" or "off", whether a program or commercial was watched to its conclusion or skipped, and whether the content was accessed during its regular airing schedule, from our on-demand service, or through a Spectrum website app, or a third party's platform. We may create similar reports in the phone and broadband contexts that measure and analyze service usage information, such as the peak times of usage, the amount of bandwidth used, and the amount – but not the content – of data stored on our systems.</span></p>
<p><span>We use these Reports for our own internal purposes, such as improving our products and services, determining what content to provide our customers, measuring the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising, and other research and analytics. We may also share these Reports with third parties, as described in "</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#sharing"><span>When and With Whom We Share Information</span></a><span>.</span><span>" In some cases, we may provide Reports to a third party for the third party's own use; however such Reports only contain de-identified and/or aggregated information. You should review the "</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"><span>Your Choices</span></a><span>" section of this Privacy Policy to understand the choices you have with respect to the sharing of this information.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Advertising Generally</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We use some of the information we collect to make the marketing and advertising you see on the Spectrum Platform more relevant to you, as well as to market the Spectrum products and services on other websites and platforms. Many of our marketing and advertising activities use information that does not personally identify you, such as your ZIP Code, your IP address, advertiser IDs and other persistent identifiers that are not directly linked to any identifiable information. Some of our marketing and advertising activities, however, do include the use of information that personally identifies you when marketing and advertising our own products and services. For example, we use your postal and email address to deliver marketing and advertising to you. We may also use Combined Information to create marketing and advertising campaigns. For information about how to limit the use of information for these purposes,&nbsp;</span><span>see the "</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"><span>Your Choices</span></a><span>" section below.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Addressable Advertising on our Cable System Applications</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We place some of the advertisements you see during live and on-demand video content on our cable system and video applications. Some of those advertisements are placed in particular shows or channels; others are shown in particular geographic areas. Some of our cable advertisements will ask for your permission to take certain actions, like mail you information or allow the advertiser to contact you. In some areas we will be able to address advertisements to your household through our cable system that will be more relevant to your interests based on your Video Usage Information and/or Combined Information. For information about how to limit the use of information for these purposes, </span><span>see the "</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"><span>Your Choices</span></a><span>" section below.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Online Advertising and Customization</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We may place "cookies" in your browser that contain information about you or your account when you set up a personalized service or customize your settings and preferences on our websites or mobile applications. Cookies enable us to help diagnose problems with our services, control the display of ads, track usage patterns, gather demographic information, analyze trends, conduct research, and otherwise administer the Spectrum services. We do not store sensitive information such as your password, e-mail address or credit card number in cookies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We use third-party service providers to place advertisements for the Spectrum services on the Internet. These providers use technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information (such as device identifiers and IP addresses) about your visits to our websites and mobile applications, as well as your interaction with our products and services. These providers may also use information about your visits to other sites to send interest-based advertisements for other products and services and to gauge the effectiveness of advertisements. We do not permit these third parties to collect or use information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address.</span></p>
<p><span>We also allow third-party ad serving companies and other unaffiliated advertisers to display advertisements on our websites and within some of our mobile applications. These third parties may collect information about you when you use the Spectrum websites and apps. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services, and across devices that you use to access the websites and mobile applications. In some cases, we may share online or device identifiers, such as an IP address, user agent, or advertising device identifier (i.e., unique identifiers generated by your device operating system for advertising purposes), with our third-party ad serving and verification partners and third-party ad sales partners as needed to support our advertising business and video programming distribution business. We may also share de-identified and/or aggregated information with our third-party advertising partners for modeling purposes. For information about how to limit the use of your information for these purposes, see the&nbsp;</span><span>"</span><a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#choices"><span>Your Choices</span></a><span>"</span><span>&nbsp;section below.</span></p>
<p><span>Your browser or device may include "Do Not Track" functionality. Our information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.</span></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WHEN AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE INFORMATION (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>We share information with others when it is necessary to provide you with the products and services you request, interact with, and to which you subscribe. We also share information with others when you direct us to do so, such as with other users on your account; when required by law or to respond to legal process; or to protect our property or rights or the safety of our employees, our customers, or other individuals. As described below, we may also share information about you with Charter/Spectrum-related businesses and divisions, such as Spectrum Networks and Spectrum Reach, for their own marketing and advertising activities.</span></p>
<p><span>We do not sell or otherwise share information that personally identifies our customers, including their Internet Usage Information, Video Usage Information, or Call Detail Information, to third parties for those third parties' own use, such as marketing or advertising of their own products and services.&nbsp; In some cases, we may share online or device identifiers, such as an IP address, user agent, or advertising device identifier (i.e., unique identifiers generated by your device operating system for advertising purposes), with our ad serving, ad sales, and ad verification partners, and other third-parties as needed to support our and our partners’ advertising and video programming distribution businesses. We may also share de-identified and/or aggregated information with our third-party advertising partners for modeling purposes.&nbsp; While we have no plans to do so, if we ever changed our business practice not to sell or share personally identifiable information, we would provide customers with advance notice and obtain their express consent.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Account Holders and Other Authorized Users</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We may disclose certain information about a customer's account and use of a service or feature to the primary account owner after appropriate authentication. The primary account owner may also authorize other users to access certain information on the account, which may include information about the primary account owner's use of the relevant service.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Charter/Spectrum Related Businesses</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We may share information about you with other Charter and Spectrum related companies in order to provide the services you have requested or to which you subscribe, or to make your Spectrum experience more streamlined, such as through combining account information into a single location for easier access. We may also share information about you with these affiliated companies for their own marketing and advertising purposes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Service Providers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We may disclose your information to service providers who perform business activities and functions on our behalf to support our interactions with you such as billing and collections, payment processing, analytics and research, marketing and advertising, service delivery and customization, maintenance and operations, and fraud prevention. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Governmental Entities or Pursuant to Valid Legal Process</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We may disclose personal information to comply with valid legal process, including subpoenas, court orders or search warrants. In some instances where there is a valid legal request or an order for disclosure of information about you, we may notify you of such request or order and then it may be up to you to object or take specific action to prevent any disclosures pursuant to those requests or orders.</span></p>
<p><span>If you subscribe to any Spectrum services, we may be required by law to disclose information about you, including information that personally identifies you, your use of our services, and the content of your communications, to governmental entities upon receipt of valid legal process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you subscribe to Spectrum cable video service and a governmental entity is seeking information about your selection of video programming, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to obtain a court order. In the proceeding relevant to the issuance of the court order, the government must provide clear and convincing evidence that you are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the video records sought would be material evidence in the prosecution of the case. You are to be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest the governmental entity's claims in such proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span>We may also disclose personal information when we believe it is necessary to protect our customers, employees, or property; in emergency situations; to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with you, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies; and/or as otherwise required by law.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Third Parties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We do not sell to or share with third parties, for their own marketing or advertising purposes, any information that personally identifies our customers or other individuals who use our products, services, or applications; however, in some cases we may disclose non-personally identifiable information, such as an IP address or device identifier, to a third-party partner as needed to support our advertising business and our video programming distribution business.</span></p>
<p><span>If you subscribe to our telephone service, your name, address and/or telephone number may be transmitted via Caller ID, published and distributed in affiliated or unaffiliated telephone directories, and available through affiliated or unaffiliated directory assistance operators. We take reasonable precautions to ensure that non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in the telephone directories or directory assistance services, although we cannot guarantee that errors will never occur. Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of your name and/or telephone number when you dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 855, 844, 866, 877 or 888 numbers. But note that Spectrum Mobile does not publish directories of customers' wireless phone numbers and we do not make those numbers available to others for listing in directories.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the advertisements we display may invite interactive or transactional follow-up from you. When you interact and provide your consent, we may share your contact information with such advertiser for the purpose of fulfilling your request. We may also share individually de-identified and/or aggregate information, including our business and marketing reports, with third parties for their own purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>If we enter into a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may transfer information about you, including information that personally identifies you, as part of the transaction.</span></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WHAT CHOICES YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE USE OF INFORMATION BY SPECTRUM (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>You have choices in controlling how we use and share your information for marketing and advertising purposes. For instance, you can always choose whether to receive promotional emails or text messages. When you visit our websites, you may opt out of interest-based advertising, and when you use our mobile applications, you can limit the use of ad trackers. You may visit our <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/your-privacy-rights-opt-out">Privacy Preferences</a> page to manage your marketing communication and privacy preferences, including, for example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>to be added to our marketing communication preferences list (e.g., "Do Not Call"), which will limit the marketing and advertising messages you receive from us about Spectrum products and services;</span></li>
<li><span>to limit our use of customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”), such as Call Detail Information, for marketing and advertising of our own products and services; and</span></li>
<li><span>to limit our use of Video Usage Information, Combined Information, or our business and marketing reports to direct addressable advertisements or interest-based advertisements to you as further described in the preference center.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Some of the preferences will only apply when you subscribe to Spectrum services and may require additional account information. If you make changes to your contact information or get a new account, you will need to review and update your privacy preferences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a Spectrum customer and do not have access to Internet service, you may call us at the number provided on your monthly bill statement to be added to any of these lists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not a Spectrum customer and would like to add your name to the Spectrum Do Not Call or Do Not Email list, please call 833-845-3726.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that even if you choose to limit the use of information or communications for marketing and advertising purposes, you may still receive general marketing and/or advertising messages, in addition to service-related messages.</span></p>

<h4>HOW WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16.&nbsp; If you believe that a child under 16 years of age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address below.</span></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WHAT YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR LIMITATIONS ARE UNDER FEDERAL LAWS (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>The federal Cable Act and the Communications Act impose limitations on our collection, use, and sharing of information that personally identifies you when you subscribe to cable video and telecommunications services, or other services provided using the facilities of the Spectrum cable system.</span></p>
<p><span>The Cable Act also limits how long we maintain information that personally identifies subscribers and provides subscribers with the right to access, review and correct that information, and in some instances limit its disclosure. These subscribers can seek to enforce the limitations imposed on us by the Cable Act through a civil action under federal law, in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available to you under federal or other applicable laws.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Cable Act and Personally Identifiable Information</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Section 631 of the federal Cable Act gives a subscriber to the Cable Act services the right to know about the personally identifiable information we collect and how we use it; under what conditions and circumstances and the types of persons and entities to whom we may disclose personally identifiable information; how long we maintain personally identifiable information; the limitation on our ability to collect and disclose personally identifiable information collected from the cable system; and a subscriber's rights under the Cable Act concerning personally identifiable information and its collection and disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a particular person; it does not include de-identified or aggregate data that does not identify a particular person or persons.</span></p>
<p><span>The Cable Act permits us to use the cable system(s) to collect personally identifiable information about our subscribers when it is necessary to render the Spectrum Cable Act Services or other services we provide and to detect unauthorized reception or use of the Spectrum Cable Act Services. We may use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information about a subscriber for additional purposes with a subscriber's prior written or electronic consent.</span></p>
<p><span>The Cable Act permits us to disclose personally identifiable information if the disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services provided; required by law or legal process; or limited to your name and address under a "mailing list" exception, as described in this Privacy Policy. <strong>At this time, we do not sell or share customer names and addresses with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes. If we decide to do this in the future, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt out of such sharing.</strong> When a government entity is seeking information about your selection of video programming, you have additional rights as described in the "Governmental Entities or Pursuant to Valid Legal Process" subsection of "<a href="https://www.spectrum.com/policies/privacy-policy.html#sharing">When We Share Information with Others</a>."</span></p>
<p><span>If you subscribe to a Spectrum service that is governed by the Cable Act, we will maintain information that personally identifies you and that is associated with your use of such service for as long as necessary for the purpose for which the information was collected, which may be as long as the duration of your subscription and after you have terminated your subscription, in some instances. For example, we may keep information that personally identifies you as necessary to comply with laws governing our business, such as tax and accounting requirements that require record retention, to satisfy pending requests for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order, or to respond to your inquiries or otherwise communicate with you after you have terminated your subscription. We will destroy or de-identify such information when it is no longer needed for such purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>If you believe that you have been aggrieved by any act of ours in violation of law, we encourage you to contact us in order to resolve your question or concern. You may also enforce the limitations imposed on us by the Cable Act with respect to your personally identifiable information through a civil lawsuit in federal district court seeking damages, attorneys' fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may be available to you under federal or other applicable laws as well. Your Spectrum Residential Services Agreement contains your agreement that, to the extent permitted by law, any claims under the Cable Act may be enforced in arbitration.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Communications Act and CPNI</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Section 222 of the Communications Act provides additional privacy protections for information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of the Spectrum telecommunications services, and information about your Spectrum phone service that is contained on your bill. This information, when linked to an identifiable customer of such service, is known as customer proprietary network information or "CPNI." CPNI does not include a customer's name, address, and telephone number</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a customer of a telecommunications service, we have an obligation under federal law to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and to provide you with information about how we use your CPNI and explain the choices you have. Those additional protections and the choices you have regarding the use and sharing of such information are reflected in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>HOW TO ACCESS AND CORRECT THE INFORMATION IN OUR RECORDS (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span>We strive to keep our records accurate. If any of your information changes, please notify us so we can update our records.</span></p>
<p><span>If you subscribe to a service subject to the federal Cable Act's requirements and you would like to see the personally identifiable information we maintain in our business records, please send a written request to your local Spectrum office or call us at the number provided on your monthly billing statement and we will make an appointment for you to visit during normal business hours. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account. If your review reveals an error in our records, we will correct it. We reserve the right to charge you for the cost of retrieving and photocopying any documents that you request. You may also be able to access certain information about you or your account by contacting one of our customer service representatives at (844) 979-1794, or by logging in to your online account.</span></p>
<p><span>If you make a written request for a copy of your CPNI, we will disclose the relevant information we have to you at the address we have for your account, or to any person authorized by you, if we reasonably believe the request is valid. For telephone and online access to your CPNI such as outbound call detail records, we require that you first authenticate your identity using a password established using our online system. We generally do not provide our customers with records of calls received, records that are only in our archives, other records that we do not furnish as part of a telephone bill, web-browsing history, IP address logs or any other information that we do not create or maintain in the ordinary course of business unless there is a court order or similar legal process. If there are errors in names, addresses, or telephone numbers in our vendors' directory lists, or if you have been omitted from the directory, the correction cannot be made until the next available publication. Please understand that we may have no control over information appearing in directory lists or provided by directory assistance services which we do not own.</span></p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL PRODUCT AND SERVICE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW (back to <a href="#top">top</a>)</h4>
<p><span><strong>Spectrum Mobile Applications</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When you use Spectrum mobile applications, we may also automatically collect information about the devices you use to access the application or our services and the content you view. The information we may automatically collect depends on how you access the services and content and includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>information related to the use and operation of the App;</li>
<li>device information (e.g., device identifier, mobile device number, advertising identifier, MAC address, carrier, operating system, ISP, IP address);</li>
<li>usage data associated with how you interact with the App;</li>
<li>configuration data for any Wi-Fi-enabled device you may use to access the App;</li>
<li>information related to your Wi-Fi and cellular connections (e.g., data usage, network performance, signal strength, throughput, latency); and</li>
<li>location information, including precise geolocation information, such as your service address and the location of a device in which you have installed the App.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Our location-based features are based on the location of your Spectrum service account and the location, including the precise geolocation, of a device in which you have both installed a mobile application (e.g., the Spectrum TV Application, My Spectrum Mobile App, Connection Manager) (each individually an "App") and have enabled location services. If you do not want the App to collect your device's precise geolocation, you can disable location services on your device using the device settings. When you use some apps, such as the Wi-Fi Finder application, Location information will allow us to identify for you the closest Wi-Fi hot spots to your location. We may also use location information for other service-related purposes such as deciding where to install new Wi-Fi hotspots in order to serve you better. Please note that location data, including precise geolocation, will be collected when your location service is enabled for this App when the App is running in the foreground, background, or even if you are not directly using the application depending on your device.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the App's features are only available while you are on the Spectrum network or when connecting from your home Wi-Fi account. The App will use your IP address and other information to determine whether you are on or off the Spectrum network or connecting via your service account.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Spectrum Mobile Service</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When you subscribe to the Spectrum Mobile service, we will also collect information about your use of the Spectrum Mobile network, the use of your device, and diagnostic data such as device performance, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength, and network performance issues. This may also include information about what apps are on your device, the fact that an app has been used, and the length of time that an app has been running. We also collect information about your use of other providers' networks when roaming domestically or internationally as well as network data related to Wi-Fi usage.</span></p>
<p><span>Location information is available when your device communicates with cell towers, Wi-Fi routers, access points, and/or with technologies used by the Global Positioning System ("GPS").</span></p>
<p><span>We use the information collected in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Other companies, like the manufacturer of your mobile device, the provider of your cellular connection, the provider of the operating system on your device, and providers of mobile applications installed on your device, may also be able to access and collect this information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the location and other information collected by those manufacturers and providers.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Spectrum Email and Data Storage Services</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you use Spectrum-provided email accounts or data storage services, we transmit, and may collect and store for a period of time, information generated by the service when you send and receive e-mail, video mail, and instant messages; transfer and share files; or make files accessible. We do not store emails sent and received unless left in a Spectrum account file. We may associate personal account information with data from third parties about you or similar persons to better predict your product and service preferences for use in programming, advertising transactions and to market our services to you. Unless addressed to us, we do not read email messages, instant messages, online chats, or the content of other online communications that reside on or pass through our networks; provided, however, we may retain, review, and provide such communications if we are legally required to do so or as part of the legal process described in the "Governmental Entities or Pursuant to Valid Legal Process" subsection of "When We Share Information with Others." Incoming and outgoing email messages are generally scanned electronically to identify and filter out likely spam and for viruses and related problems that could harm your equipment, the network or other users.</span></p>

In order to join the Spectrum Talent Network, you must provide certain contact information, such as your name and email address, which Spectrum uses to send job alerts and relevant communications and updates.&nbsp; If you no longer want to receive communications from the Spectrum Talent Network team, you can unsubscribe at any time.
