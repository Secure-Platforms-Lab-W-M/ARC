For example, we may collect or receive your contact information, payment and billing information, Whirlpool account information, demographic information, preferences, purchase history, location (including precise geolocation), product and ownership information, details of extended warranty or service plans you purchase, and repair information and history for your products. We may also collect or receive device, Internet, and network activity information, including your IP address, Smart Appliance ID, the type of browser and operating system you use, your navigation through our Services, and other information about your use of our Services.</p>

				<div><h3>I.&nbsp; INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<p>“Personal Information” is information that relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with you or your household, and may include Usage Information. “Usage Information” refers to device, Internet and network activity information that Whirlpool, our business partners, and our service providers collect, including information about how you interact with our Services, emails, advertising, and content. We may combine Usage Information with other Personal Information we have about you.</p>
<p>We collect information you provide to us, Usage Information, and may also receive information from other parties, as further described below.</p>
<h5><strong>1. Information you provide directly to us</strong></h5>
<p>You may provide your Personal Information in a variety of situations, including when you sign up for a Whirlpool account, contact us, sign up to receive communications from us, purchase a product or service, submit your product registration, submit a customer service or rebate request, enter a sweepstakes or contest, provide us feedback or survey responses, or otherwise use any of the Services. Categories of Personal Information you provide may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers and Contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, social media information, and phone number</li>
<li>Demographic information, such as your gender, birth date, and ag</li>
<li>Billing and payment information, such as your credit card number and billing address</li>
<li>Whirlpool account information, including your user name, account number, and password</li>
<li>Product and ownership information and purchase history</li>
<li>Your general location, such as through your ZIP code or IP address</li>
<li>The precise location of your device or Smart Appliance (as determined, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, and WiFi signals) in connection with the Smart Appliance connection proces</li>
<li>Preferences, such as product wish lists, order history, and marketing preferences</li>
<li>Feedback about our products and services</li>
<li>Other information that you submit, post, or otherwise choose to share with us</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this information may be considered “sensitive” under the laws of certain jurisdictions (“Sensitive Information”). Whether information is Sensitive Information will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We also may give you the option of submitting Personal Information, such as email address, of other individuals so we can send them invitations to use the Services (for example, to let them connect to your Smart Appliance or to send them a gift, special offer, or invitation).</p>
<p>Our Services may also collect images, video, audio, or other content. For example, a Smart Appliance might capture images of your food to recognize and automatically cook it; you might submit photos of suspected product issues so that we can help you resolve them. Or you might tell us what cooking or laundry task you are performing so we can offer you customized tips. We might also collect information from you to help us improve our products and services.</p>
<p>We may use information that you provide to draw inferences about you, such as your preferences and characteristics.</p>
<h5><strong>2. Usage Information.</strong></h5>
<p>Usage Information we collect may include: (i) your device ID and IP address, which is a unique set of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP); (ii) the type of browser and operating system you use; (iii) your Smart Appliance ID, serial and part numbers, other device identifiers, and IP address, including when you connect a Smart Appliance to our network; (iv) the physical location of your device or Smart Appliance (as determined, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, and WiFi signals); and (v) if you use our App, where you downloaded it and how often you use it. We may collect other Usage Information about your online sessions, such as the URL you came from to get to our Websites, the sites you visit when you leave us, and the method you used to browse away from the page. This may include Website page and App interaction information and other electronic communications and content from your use of the Website and App. This might also include the date, time, and location of your visit; the areas of the Website and App you visit and for how long; what search terms, contact information, or other data you enter; mouse movements; screen captures; products or content you view; or links you click.</p>
<p>After you connect a Smart Appliance to our network, we may automatically collect Usage Information from the Smart Appliance on a periodic basis, including status (such as whether the Smart Appliance is off or on, and details about the cycle or function it is performing), instructions that have been entered on the Smart Appliance, and aspects of its environment that may affect how it operates (such as input voltage, signal strength, and air temperature). We may also track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App accesses our servers, your interactions with the App, what information has been downloaded to the App, and the instructions that are transmitted to the Smart Appliance.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> Our Services use tracking technologies to collect Personal Information, including Usage Information. These tracking technologies include, by way of example, cookies, pixels, and tags. While these technologies operate in different ways, in general, they allow us, our service providers, and other third parties to collect and combine information about your online activities over time and across different websites and apps. For example, they allow us to determine how many people are visiting our Websites and other analytics, whether visitors are new or repeat visitors, which pages visitors are viewing and for how long, how people are interacting with our sites, how well certain online advertising campaigns are converting, and other similar usage data. When used in our e-mail communications, they can tell us information such as how you interact with the e-mail, when and whether an e-mail was opened, if and how many times it was forwarded, and what links users click within the e-mail. They support the way we serve our ads, measure the effectiveness of our ads, and to determine the content and advertising to offer you based on your interests.
