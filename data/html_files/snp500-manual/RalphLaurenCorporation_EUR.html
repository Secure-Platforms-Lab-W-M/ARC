<title>Do you have sizing guidelines?</title>
<div>
<p>Please use the following guidelines along with a fabric tape measure to be certain you’re ordering the right size. When taking your measurements, wear little or no clothing.</p>
<p>Waist - Measure around your natural waistline, keeping the tape comfortably loose.</p>
<p>Hips - Stand with your heels together and measure around the fullest part of your hips.</p>
<p>Chest - Wrap the tape around the fullest part of your chest or bust, including your shoulder blades, then drop your arms to your sides to measure.</p>
<p>Neck - Measure around the middle of neck (at the Adam’s apple). Allow room for your index finger to fit between the tape and your neck for a comfortable fit.</p>
<p>Inseam - With the appropriate shoes on, measure from your crotch to your desired pant length.</p>

• QR code</p>
<p>How to Use<br>
The battery should be attached using the USB attachment in the Jacket. To operate, please use the dedicated app, RL HEAT that can be downloaded via the App Store or Google Play.</p>

<p>Care Instructions:<br>
Please remove the battery before washing. Refer to the care tag on the Jacket or the user manual included for specific washing instructions.</p>

<p>If you purchase more than one heated jacket, a maximum of two will be in a parcel, so you may also have more than one shipment per order.</p>

On a full charge, the battery will last up to 10 hours on a low setting and up to 3 hours on a high setting. Other USB batteries can also be used to heat the jacket.</p>
<p>Your Mophie battery is a gift with the purchase of the Polo 11 or Glacier jackets, therefore we are unable to replace these.</p>

<p>We reserve the right at any time after receipt of your order to decline your order, or any part thereof, in our sole discretion, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or after your chosen payment method has been charged. &nbsp;If we cancel after your chosen payment method has been charged we will refund the payment to you.</p>

<p>By making an offer to purchase products through our Website, you authorise us to perform credit and anti-fraud checks on you and the payment mechanism that you have provided. These checks may be required, amongst other things, to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit or debit card, to obtain an initial credit or debit card authorisation and/or to authorise individual purchases. You authorise us to disclose information provided by you, including personal information, to third parties such as banks and the providers of credit reports for the purposes of these checks, and acknowledge that such parties may keep a record of that information. You further agree and acknowledge that we may make the information we receive from such checks available to third parties including fraud prevention and credit reference agencies. We reserve the right to put in place additional payment security systems from time to time.</p>
<p>For your convenience, your credit or debit card information can be stored in Your Account. For more information, see our Privacy Notice. For added security, the billing address you provide must exactly match the address on file at your debit or credit card. The processing of your order may be delayed if these addresses are different.</p>
<p>We will prosecute any fraudulent activities relating to any attempt to reverse or seek a refund of a valid charge for an order that has been properly fulfilled and delivered to you and is not subject to a right of return.</p>
<p>Order Tracking and Delivery</p>
<p>Once your order has been confirmed, we endeavour to dispatch purchases within one (1) to two (2) working days of confirming your order (working days exclude Saturdays, Sundays and Public holidays), and to deliver your order in accordance with the timescales set out in our&nbsp;Shipping Policy&nbsp;. Stated delivery times are estimates only, and are measured from the date of dispatch. Each address you instruct us to deliver to, including gift-recipient addresses, is considered a separate order and is subject to applicable delivery charges. Customising a product requires additional processing time for your entire order, and all orders that include RL Custom Shop product may take longer to deliver.</p>
<p>Once your order is placed, we will send an e-mail confirming the details of your order and the selected delivery method. Your Order History on the Website lists the current status of pending orders. You may check your order status through the Order History area of My Account or the Track Your Orders option. You can also Contact Us. &nbsp;We will email you a confirmation once your order is ready for dispatch.</p>
<p>We require a signature for all products delivered using this Website. All responsibility and risk for the products you have purchased through this Website passes to you on delivery. In the event that you have purchased a product as a gift for a third party you agree that signature by a person at the stated delivery address is proof of fulfilment of your order.</p>
<p>For security reasons, Ralph Lauren cannot ship any order to Post Office Boxes &nbsp;or accept any order where it is impossible to identify the individual delivery address. Ralph Lauren's policies do not allow product to be reshipped and therefore we cannot ship to an address associated with a "freight forwarding company". We do not deliver outside Ireland.

Ralph Lauren remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if the company’s third-party Processor onward transfer recipients process relevant Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Ralph Lauren proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p></div></section><section><h2>Security</h2><div><p>Ralph Lauren takes reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Consumer Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data.</p></div></section><section><h2>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</h2><div><p>Ralph Lauren limits the Consumer Personal Data it processes to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. &nbsp; Ralph Lauren does not process Consumer Personal Data in ways that are incompatible with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by the relevant Consumer. &nbsp;In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, Ralph Lauren takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data the company processes is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current. &nbsp;In this regard, Ralph Lauren relies on its Consumers to update and correct the relevant Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. &nbsp;Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as indicated below to request that Ralph Lauren update or correct relevant Personal Data. &nbsp;</p><p>Subject to applicable law, Ralph Lauren retains Consumer Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders identifiable the relevant Consumer only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by the Consumer.</p></div></section><section><h2>Access</h2><div><p>Consumers generally have the right to access their Personal Data. &nbsp;Accordingly, where appropriate, Ralph Lauren provides Consumers with reasonable access to the Personal Data Ralph Lauren maintains about them. &nbsp;Ralph Lauren also provides a reasonable opportunity for those Consumers to correct, amend or delete the information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, as appropriate. &nbsp;Ralph Lauren may limit or deny access to Personal Data where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Consumer’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the Consumer would be violated. &nbsp;Consumers may request access to their Personal Data by contacting Ralph Lauren as indicated below.</p></div></section><section><h2>Recourse, Enforcement and Liability</h2><div><p>Ralph Lauren has mechanisms in place designed to help assure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. &nbsp;Ralph Lauren conducts an annual self-assessment of its Consumer Personal Data practices to verify that the attestations and assertions Ralph Lauren makes about its Privacy Shield privacy practices are true and that Ralph Lauren’s privacy practices have been implemented as represented and in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p><p>Consumers may file a complaint concerning Ralph Lauren’s processing of their Personal Data. &nbsp;Ralph Lauren will take steps to remedy issues arising out of its alleged failure to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles. &nbsp;Consumers may contact Ralph Lauren as specified below about complaints regarding Ralph Lauren’s Consumer Personal Data practices. &nbsp;</p><p>If a Consumer’s complaint cannot be resolved through Ralph Lauren’s internal processes, Ralph Lauren will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Privacy Shield Program, which is described on the JAMS website at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/international-mediation-rules" rel="nofollow">&nbsp;https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.</a>&nbsp; JAMS mediation may be commenced as provided for in the JAMS rules. &nbsp;Following the dispute resolution process, the mediator or the Consumer may refer the matter to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which has Privacy Shield investigatory and enforcement powers over Ralph Lauren.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Under certain circumstances, Consumers also may be able to invoke binding arbitration to address complaints about Ralph Lauren’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p></div></section><section><h2>How to Contact Ralph Lauren</h2><div><p>To contact Ralph Lauren with questions or concerns about this Policy or Ralph Lauren’s Consumer Personal Data practices:</p><p>Write to:</p><p>&nbsp;Ralph Lauren Corporation</p><p>&nbsp;Attention: Chief Privacy Officer</p><p>&nbsp;100 Metro Boulevard</p><p>&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup> Floor</p><p>&nbsp;Nutley, NJ 07710</p><p>or</p><p>&nbsp;Ralph Lauren Europe Sàrl<br>&nbsp;Attention: General Counsel EMEA<br>&nbsp;24, Route de la Galaise,<br>&nbsp;1228 Plan-Les-Ouates<br>&nbsp;Switzerland&nbsp;</p><p>E-mail: &nbsp;DataProtectionOfficer@ralphlauren.com</p></div></section></div><div><span>8th Feb 2020</span><span>12/22/2022, 12:00:53 PM</span></div></div></div>
