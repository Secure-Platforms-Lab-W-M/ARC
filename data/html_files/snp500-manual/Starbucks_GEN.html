This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Starbucks affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.</p><p><strong>(a) &nbsp;Lawful Bases of Processing</strong> – Where a Starbucks entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in this Notice, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so. Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:</p><ul><li>to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to:
<ul><li>process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering</li><li>gift cards in accordance with your instructions;</li><li>communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs,</li><li>contests, and sweepstakes;</li></ul></li><li>for our legitimate business purposes, including to:

This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li><li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you.</li><li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.</li><li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li><li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you.</li><li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to another party, when possible.</li><li><strong>Not be subject to automated decision-making</strong> producing legal or significant effects on an individual, which we do not engage in.</li></ul><p>To exercise any of these rights, please see the “Your Choices &amp; Rights” section, or contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise.

We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations.</p><p><strong>(d)&nbsp; Transfers Outside the EEA</strong> – Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. &nbsp;It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Starbucks or for our third-party service providers. In such cases, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of data protection of the recipient as required under the GDPR and as described in this Notice.</p><p><strong>(e)&nbsp; Complaints</strong> – If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority (link). We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us per the “Contact Us” section below, or to our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a> You may also contact our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@starbucks.com">privacy@starbucks.com</a>.</p><ol start="15"><li><strong>Participation in the Privacy Shield Frameworks</strong></li></ol><p>On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a transfer mechanism for data between EU and U.S. companies.
