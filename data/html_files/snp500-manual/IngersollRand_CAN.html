<h2>3. HOW AND WHEN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, exchange or rent your personal data to unrelated third parties for marketing purposes. We may share your personal data with third parties in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service providers and business partners: We may share your personal data with our service providers and business partners who provide us with marketing services and other business operations for the purposes set out above. For example, we may partner with companies to process secure payments, fulfill orders, optimize services, provide online behavioral advertising, send newsletters and marketing messages, support email and messaging services, and analyze information.

<ul>
<li>When required by law: We may share your personal data with law enforcement authorities, courts, other government authorities or third parties where we believe it is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of others.</li>

Unless we notify you otherwise, any sharing of your personal information pursuant to this Chapter 3 is of a processor-to-contractor nature.</p>

<p><span>CCPA</span></p>
<p>The CCPA provides California residents (“consumers”) with the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to Know: Consumers have a right to request information about the categories of personal information we have collected, used, sold, and disclosed about them, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared their personal information. Consumers also have a right to request that we disclose the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about them with certain exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to Delete: Consumers have a right to request the deletion of personal information that we have collected from them, though certain exceptions may</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right to Opt-out of Sales: California law treats disclosures of personal information in exchange for valuable consideration as “sales.” Consumers have the right to opt-out of such sales. As stated above, Ingersoll Rand’s disclosures of personal information do not constitute a sale under the CCPA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Non-Discrimination: We may not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the We may, however, provide a different level of service or charge a different rate if the difference is reasonably related to the value of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the CCPA includes an exemption for certain personal information that is collected in a business-to-business (“B2B”) context. Therefore, the rights described above do not apply to personal data that is subject to the B2B exception. Also, for California job applicants, employees, and former employees of our US Ingersoll-Rand affiliates, separate notices and policies exist which inform them about our activities and their rights under the CCPA with respect to their personal information.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, or an authorized agent acting on behalf of a California resident, and would like to exercise your right to know or delete, please email <span>Data.Privacy@irco.com </span>or submit a CCPA Data Privacy request via Ingersoll Rand’s global hotline at 1-844-439-4693. All CCPA requests must provide sufficient information for us to reasonably verify the identity of the person making the request, therefore we require that you provide us two or three pieces of personal information which we will match to personal information we maintain in our records. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf (i.e., your authorized agent), may make a request related to your personal information. We may require an authorized agent to provide verification that they are acting on your behalf when they submit a request related to your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>GDPR</span><span> - EU</span></p>
<p>If you are working with our affiliates in the EU or are a data subject in the EU protected by GDPR, you can invoke your rights under GDPR towards the relevant EU Ingersoll-Rand affiliate that controls your personal data at local, national level for the performance of the day to day operations of the relevant affiliate, each acting as a separate controller. For all cross-border processing of personal data in the EEA at group level, the controller is:</p>

In such case, the processing of personal data by the relevant Ingersoll-Rand entities may be based on the necessity to perform a contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, because we have a legal obligation to do so, or because it is in our legitimate interest to do so (for instance if you are working for one of our suppliers or customers who have to receive your data for normal business operations, or because you want to browse through our website), or, alternatively, may be based on your consent (for instance when you have consented to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the GPDR individuals have:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right of access to the personal data that the relevant controller processes about the individual concerned, as well as a right of rectification and erasure of their data;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the right to obtain from the relevant controller restriction of processing of the individual’s personal data, and the right to object to the processing;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the right to obtain from the relevant controller in a structured, commonly used and machine- readable format, the personal data the individual has communicated to the controller in order to transmit this data to another controller (the so-called “right to data portability”);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the right to withdraw at all times the individual’s consent with respect to the processing which would possibly be based on the individual’s consent, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory</li>
</ul>
<p>Enforcement of these rights may be subject to certain conditions and exceptions as established by the LGPD. Individuals who wish to exercise these rights can do so by contacting:</p>
