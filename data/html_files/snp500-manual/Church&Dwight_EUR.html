</ul>

<p>We will let you know which information is required or optional  (on the form on which we collect your data or, where applicable, orally).  Failure to provide the information required may prevent us from responding to  you or providing you with the product or service you request.</p>
<p>If you make a purchase on the Sites, we will also create and  keep a record of your orders, purchase history, and shopping behavior and  preferences based on the information you provided in connection with your  purchase(s).</p>
<p>The personal data collected through our Sites may be combined  and maintained with personal data we collect from you offline or from third  parties for the purposes described in the “How We use Your Information” section below.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Collection  of Information</strong></p>
<p>When you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by  automated means, such as cookies, pixel tags, web server logs and other  technologies. The information we collect in this manner may include your device  IP address, unique device identifier, web browser characteristics, device  characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,  clickstream data, and dates and times of Site visits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cookies are small data  files stored on your computer or device at the request of a website. A cookie  assigns a unique numerical identifier to your web browser, and may enable us to  recognize you as the same user who visited our Sites in the past, and relate  your use of the Sites to other information about you. Cookies may also be used  to enhance your experience on the Sites (for example, by storing your username  so you can log in easily, keeping you logged in to the Sites after you have  provided your password, and storing the contents of your shopping cart as you  browse), to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information about  our Sites, detect and prevent fraud, and tailor the advertising you receive  from us to your interests. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give  you an opportunity to reject them, but please note that without cookies you may  not be able to use all of the features of the Sites.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A pixel tag (also  known as a "clear GIF" or "web beacon") is a tiny image  that links webpages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to  transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. This can  be placed on a webpage or in our electronic communications to you to help us  measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number  of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you've opened one of  our emails or visited our Sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see our cookie banner or&nbsp;<u><a href="http://www.churchdwight.co.uk/cookie-notice.aspx">Cookie Notice</a></u>&nbsp;for more information on our use of cookies and to set your  preferences.</p>
<p><em><u>Third-Party Analytics Services</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>We use third-party analytics  services on our Sites, such as Google Analytics, to help us analyze your use of  the Sites. The information collected through these means (including IP address)  may be disclosed to these analytics providers, and other relevant third parties  who use the information to evaluate use of the Sites. To opt out of Google  Analytics, please visit &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><u>Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising</u></em></p>
<ul>
  <li>On our Sites, we and third parties (such as ad  networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms)  may collect information about your online activities over time and across our Sites  and third-party websites, to provide you with advertising about products and  services tailored to your interests. You may see certain ads on other websites  based on your visits to our Sites because we participate in advertising  networks administered by third-party vendors. Ad networks allow us to target  our messaging to users considering demographic data, users' inferred interests  and browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by  collecting information through automated means, including through the use of  cookies, web beacons and web server logs. The networks use this information to  show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests. The  information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your  visits to websites that participate in the vendors' advertising networks, such  as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the  websites. This data collection takes place both on our Sites and on third-party  websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track  the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. For more information about  third-party advertisers and how to opt out of interest-based advertising, visit  the NAI's consumer website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a> or Aboutads info at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Typically, we use the personal data we collect about you for the  following legitimate business purposes:</p>

  <li>to  conduct polls, surveys and consumer testing;</li>
  <li>to manage and  communicate with you about our loyalty programs;</li>

  <li>to customize  our Sites to your interests and history with us, and tailor ads displayed to you on  third-party websites to your interests  based on the record of your orders, purchase history and shopping behavior and  preferences;</li>
  <li>to respond to your  questions, requests or comments;</li>
  <li>to protect against, monitor, detect and prevent fraud,  unauthorized transactions, claims and other liabilities; </li>
  <li>to protect against and prevent system vulnerabilities and other  information security risks; </li>
  <li>to handle claims or  complaints we receive in connection with our products and services, to protect  our rights and property and to enforce our legal claims, including complying  with any preservation or disclosure obligation we may have in anticipation or  in the context of legal proceedings;</li>
  <li>to contact you with  reminders and updates (including order updates); </li>
  <li>to perform accounting,  auditing, billing, reconciliation, collection and other internal functions;</li>

</ul>

<p>We will use your personal data for these  purposes based on one of the following grounds: if we have obtained your  consent, or, as the case may be, if it is necessary to perform a contract to  which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a  contract with us, if it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which  we are subject, or if we have a legitimate interest to do so (including a  legitimate interest in processing and enforcing legal claims, monitoring and  preventing fraud, and performing marketing activities, data statistics, market  and consumer research and other analyses, as well as audits and searches of  documents, e.g., in response to requests for litigation hold or pre-trial  discovery requests). Where we rely  on our legitimate interests, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the  interests we pursue are balanced with your interests, rights and freedoms,  which we are happy to explain upon request. </p>
<p>We may also use  the personal data for other purposes for which we provide specific notice at  the time of collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We may use your electronic contact details, or permit our brands  to use your electronic contact details, to provide you with promotional e-mails  or text messages about Church &amp; Dwight and/or our brands if you have  consented to receive these e-mails/text messages or, where permitted by  applicable law, if you have not opted out. You can opt out of receiving  e-mail/text communications from us or our brands at any time by following the  instructions which are contained in all e-mail/text communications or  contacting us as specified in the How to Contact Us section below.</p>
<p><strong>With Whom We share Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Your personal data will be processed by authorized personnel of  Church &amp; Dwight only on a need-to-know basis, including Church &amp;  Dwight’s customer relations, marketing, finance, accounting, legal, IT and  regulatory or compliance services.</p>
<p>We will, however, share your personal data with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>other affiliates of  the Church &amp; Dwight group of companies for the purposes described above; </li>
  <li>our third party  service providers, who perform specific business support services on our behalf  and based on our instructions, or other business partners. The provision of  these services may involve access to your personal data. We do not authorize our third party service providers to use  or disclose the personal data except as necessary to perform services on our  behalf or to comply with legal requirements, as provided by contract.&nbsp;Examples of third party service providers or  business partners (mainly based in the U.S.) include companies that assist us  with fulfilling coupons, sending e-mails, conducting and administering contests  and promotions, executing surveys, managing customer relations and in case of  purchases made on our Sites, processing card payments, monitoring and  preventing fraud, and/or shipping or fulfilling orders, information security  service providers and other service providers that support our business  operations; and</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>our co-sponsor(s) if we obtain your personal data in       connection with a contest, sweepstake, offering, or other promotional       activity that is jointly offered by us and any third parties, to the       extent permitted by applicable law. </li>
</ul>
<p>We will disclose your personal data to other parties, only with  your consent, unless when we are required to do so or permitted to do so by  law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request. In  particular, we may disclose your personal data to regulatory authorities to  comply with our reporting obligations and to adverse parties in litigation or  governmental entities in accordance with applicable law. We also will disclose  your personal data where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our  rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate  fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request, or to comply  with our legal obligations. </p>
<p>We also reserve the right to transfer personal data we hold  about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or  assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization,  divestiture, dissolution or liquidation). The recipient of personal data  following such actions may have privacy policies that differ from those in this  Notice.</p>

<p><strong>Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Certain of the above recipients are located in countries other  than the country where the data originally was collected, including outside the  European Union. In particular, we may transfer your personal data to other  group companies, including our parent company in the U.S. and sister companies  in Australia, Canada, Brazil, China and Mexico to manage customer functions  globally within the group. Duly authorized personnel of our group companies may  have access to all your data for this purpose on a need-to-know basis only. In  addition, if you contact our consumer relations department about our products,  we will transfer your personal data to our U.S. service provider that provides  consumer relations management services on our behalf. This service provider will  have access to your contact information and complaint or query-related data for  this purpose. The laws in the above countries (except Canada) have not been  recognized by the European Commission as providing for an adequate level of  data protection. Church &amp; Dwight concluded data transfer agreements  incorporating the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure  such a level. You may obtain a copy of these agreements by contacting us as  specified in the How to Contact Us section below. </p>

<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards  designed to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful  destruction, loss, alteration, access, unauthorized disclosure or access.  Service providers who might have access to your personal data in order to  provide services on our behalf will be contractually obliged to keep such  personal data in confidence and provide adequate data security measures.</p>

<p><strong>How Long We Retain Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Typically, we keep your personal data for the duration of our  relationship, plus a reasonable period in order to be able to run regular  blocking/deletion routines, or to take into account the applicable statute of  limitation period or if required under mandatory applicable law. Your personal  data may be kept for a shorter or longer period depending on the purposes for  which your data were collected.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Our Sites are intended for visitors over eighteen years of age.  We do not target our Sites to appeal to children under the age of thirteen and  we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of  thirteen.</p>

<p>In accordance with applicable data protection law, you have the  right to request access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data.  You also have the right to request that the processing of your personal data is  restricted or to object to such processing if permitted by applicable law. If  you have consented to our use of your personal data, you have the right to  withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future and without  providing reasons. Where applicable, you have the right to receive the personal  data, that you provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable  format and to transmit those data to another data controller. You may also  define the ways how your personal data will be processed after your death,  where permitted by applicable law.
