Discover uses interest-based advertising to target its advertising more effectively. Interest-based advertising includes ads served to you after you leave our Website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities. These ads may be served on websites or apps and may also be served in e-mails. We may serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads. They may be about our products or other companies' products.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How you can opt out of interest-based advertising.</b>&nbsp;There are several ways you can opt out of interest-based advertising.</p>
<ol>
<li>You&nbsp;can generally opt out of receiving interest-based ads from Discover or its partners&nbsp;<a href="https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/1142?v=1" title="opt-out tool">using this tool</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>You can opt out right from the ad itself. Ads served using interest-based advertising will have an Advertising Option icon in the ad. If you see that icon on Discover ads, you can click on it. You will then get an option to opt out.</li>
<br>
<li>The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising provides consumers with the ability to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" title="more online behavior opt-out options">opt out of having their online behavior recorded</a>&nbsp;and used for advertising purposes generally.</li>
<br>
<li>On mobile devices, you can control device-level advertising privacy settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you opt out via methods 1-3 above, your choice will be stored as a cookie and will be specific to the browser which was used to make the selection. If you remove or delete cookies you will need to renew your preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>We use common tracking technologies for a variety of reasons.</b><br>
We use tracking tools:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>To recognize new or past customers;</li>
<br>
<li>To store your password if you are registered on our Website or Mobile Apps;</li>
<br>
<li>To improve our Website and Mobile Apps;</li>
<br>
<li>To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below for more on interest-based advertising);</li>
<br>
<li>To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms; and</li>
<br>
<li>To better understand the interests of our customers and our Website and Mobile Apps visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br>
How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?</b>&nbsp;To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our affiliates, and other third parties. We gather this information using the tracking tools described above. For example, we or our Service Providers or Business Partners may look at your purchases or browsing behaviors. We may look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.</p>
<p>We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties may link your name or e-mail address, for example, to other information they collect. That may include past purchases made offline or online. Or, it may include online usage information.</p>
<p><b>You can control tracking tools on our Online Services.</b>&nbsp;Our Online Services do not respond to browser-level "do not track" settings because this setting is not universal across browsers. However, your browser may give you the ability to control tracking tools like cookies and pixel tags. How you do so depends on the type of tracking tools. Certain browsers can be set to clear past and reject future tracking tools. If you block tracking tools on your browser, certain features of our Online Services may not work. Additionally, if you block or delete tracking tools, not all of the tracking activities we have described here will stop. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific<span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>We also advertise in other ways.</b>&nbsp;If you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see Discover ads. These are ads that are not based on your Internet browsing history. Some may be generic. Others may be targeted to you or an advertising segment you are in. The websites or services where targeted ads appear will have instructions about how to modify your advertising preferences within those sites. We encourage you to review those instructions and settings.</p>
