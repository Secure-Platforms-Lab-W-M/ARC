To the extent Other Data reveal your specific identity or relate to an individual, we will treat Other Data as Personal Data.</p>
<p>“Other Data” includes:</p>
<p><strong>System Data:</strong> When you use both desktop and mobile devices to access the Online Services, we collect certain data through your browser or automatically through your device, such as your computer type, screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Online Services you are using.</p>
<p><strong>IP Address:</strong>&nbsp;We also collect your IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to the device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files when a user accesses the Online Services, along with the time of the visit and the pages that were visited. We use IP addresses to calculate usage levels, diagnose server problems and administer the Online Services. We also may derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Precise Location-Based Services:</strong> With your consent, we may collect the precise physical location of your device by using satellite, cell phone tower, Wi-Fi signals, or other technologies. We will collect this data if you opt-in through the App or other program (either during your initial login or later) to improve special offers and to enable location-driven capabilities on your device. If you have opted-in to share your location, the App or other program will continue to collect location data based on how you chose to share the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Precise Location Opt-Out:</strong> You can specify via your device’s operating system (such as through the “Settings” icon) to always share location data, only when the App is in use, or never. If you choose only when the App is in use, we will have access to the data until you log off or close the application or until you use your phone’s or other device’s settings to disable location capabilities for the Bonvoy™ App or other program.</li>

<p>This Privacy Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for the privacy, data, or other practices of any entities outside of the Marriott Group, including Franchisees, Owners, Homes and Villas Property Management Companies, Authorized Licensees, Strategic Business Partners, or any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link, payment service, loyalty program, or website that is the landing page of the high-speed Internet providers at our properties. The inclusion of a link on the Online Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us. We generally have no control over, and are not responsible for, any third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data.</p>

<p>In addition, we are not responsible for the data collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Data you disclose to other organizations through or the Apps or our social media pages.</p>

<p><b><u>Security</u></b></p>

<p>We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the “<a href="/about/privacy.mi#contact-us">Contact Us</a>” section, below.</p>

<p><b><u>Retention</u></b></p>

<p>We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services)</li>

<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them)</li>

<li>Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations)</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Sensitive Data</u></b></p>

<p>Unless specifically requested, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, on or through the Services or otherwise to us, any Sensitive Personal Data (<i>e.g.</i>, social security number, taxpayer identification number, passport number, driver’s license number, or other government-issued identification number; credit or debit card details or financial account number, with or without any code or password that would permit access to the account, credit history; or information on race, religion, ethnicity, sex life or practices or sexual orientation, medical or health information, genetic or biometric information, biometric templates, political or philosophical beliefs, political party or trade union membership, background check information, judicial data such as criminal records, or information on other judicial or administrative proceedings).</p>

<p><b><u>Use of Services by Minors</u></b></p>

<p>The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16), and we request that they not provide Personal Data through the Services.</p>

<p><b><u>International Data Transfers</u></b></p>

<p>The Marriott Group is a global organization and provides a global service. Transferring data internationally is essential to the Services so that you receive the same high-quality service wherever you are in the world. As a result, we will, subject to law, transfer Personal Data and Other Data collected in connection with the Services, to entities in countries where data protection standards may differ from those in the country where you reside, including outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland. By making a reservation, visiting, or staying at a Marriott branded property or using any Marriott Group branded service, you understand that we transfer your Personal Data globally.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Data.</p>

<p>Some of the countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a><u><img src="https://www.marriott.com/Images/Arrows/icon_newwindow_9x8.gif" alt="Open in a new browser tab"></u>). The Marriott Group enters into Standard Contractual Clauses or another approved mechanism for cross-border transfer where appropriate.</p>
