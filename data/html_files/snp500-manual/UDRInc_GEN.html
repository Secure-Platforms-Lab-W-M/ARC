<h2>UDR Inc. <strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>Last Updated: November 17, 2022</p>
<h3><strong>1. Acceptance of Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to UDR Inc., (“UDR” “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) and our Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”). This Privacy Policy is important and affects your legal rights, so please read carefully.</p>
<p>By accessing or using <strong>www.udr.com </strong>and various related websites and services (collectively, the “<strong>UDR</strong> <strong>Services</strong>”), you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference. By using the UDR Services and/or submitting or collecting any personal data via the UDR Services, you accept and expressly consent and agree to our practices surrounding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not address our practices regarding information that we collect through any website, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Privacy Policy govern the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates (“Affiliated Entities”) or by third parties. If you do not consent and agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you cannot, and we do not authorize you to, access, browse, or use the UDR Services.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number, shall be undertaken consistent with the requirements of applicable privacy laws.</p>
<h3><strong>2.&nbsp;Information We Collect</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>2.1 Personal Information We Collect Directly from You</strong></h3>
<p>We receive personal information directly from you when you voluntarily provide us with such personal information, including, without limitation, the following:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;personal information&nbsp;(such as your e-mail address and phone number);<br>(2)&nbsp;financial information (such as income level and credit card number); <br>(3) demographic information (such as your age and zip code); and&nbsp; <br>(4)&nbsp;other identifying information that you voluntarily choose to provide to us, including without limitation unique identifiers such as passwords, and personal information in messages you send to us.</p>
<p>We may also collect additional information, which may be personal information, as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2.2 Information We Automatically Collect When You Use Our Site</strong></h3>
<p>In order to access and use certain areas or features of the UDR Services, you consent to our collection and use of certain information about your use of the UDR Services through the use of tracking technologies or by other passive means. Your consent to our access and use of this “passively collected” information includes, but is not limited to, the domain name of the website that allowed you to navigate to the UDR Services, search engines used, the internet protocol (IP) address used, the length of time spent on the UDR Services, the pages you looked at on the UDR Services, other webpages you visited before and after visiting the UDR Services, the type of device and/or internet browser you have, the frequency of your visits to the UDR Services, and other relevant statistics (collectively “Traffic Data”):</p>
<h3><strong>3.&nbsp;How We Collect Information</strong></h3>
<p>We collect information (including personal information and Traffic Data) when you use and interact with the UDR Services, and in some cases from third party sources. Such means of collection include:<br><br>• When you use the UDR Services’ interactive tools and services;<br>• When you voluntarily provide information in free-form text boxes through the UDR Services or through responses to surveys, questionnaires and the like;<br>• If you use a location-enabled browser, we may receive information about your location and mobile device, as applicable;<br>• Through Cookies, web beacons, analytics services and other tracking technology (collectively, “Tracking Tools<strong>”</strong>), as described below; and<br>• When you use the “Contact Us” function on the UDR Services, send us an email or otherwise contact us.</p>
<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;Tracking Tools, Behavioral Advertising, and Opt Out Options</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>4.1.&nbsp;Tracking Tools</strong></h3>
<p>We may use tools outlined below in order to provide the UDR Services, advertise to, and better understand users.</p>
<p><strong>Automated technologies or interactions.</strong> As you interact with us via the UDR Services, we will automatically collect data about your equipment, browsing actions, activity, and patterns. We collect this data by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technologies. We will also collect data about your usage of UDR Services. We may also receive data about you if you visit other websites employing our cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong> <br>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the UDR Services may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please review the Cookie Preferences available on the Site.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2.&nbsp;Behavioral Advertising</strong></h3>
<p>We may use a type of advertising commonly known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising.&nbsp; This means that some of our partners use Tracking Tools to collect information about a user’s online activities to display UDR ads to the user based on the user’s interests&nbsp;(“Behavioral Advertising”). Such partners may include third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks or platforms, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third party service providers (collectively, “Advertising Service Providers”).&nbsp; Other Tracking Tools used by our partners may collect information when you use the Site, such as IP address, mobile device ID, operating system, browser, web page interactions, geographic location and demographic information, such as gender and age range.&nbsp; These Tracking Tools help UDR learn more about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.</p>
<h3><strong>4.3.&nbsp;Options for Opting out of Cookies and Mobile Device Identifiers</strong></h3>
<p>If we process Cookies based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any point in time by contacting us at privacy@udr.com. Please note, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide your consent on a case-by-case basis for the use by us or disclosure of certain Cookies, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our services.</p>
<p>Some web browsers allow you to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer, tablet or mobile device. You may be able to reject mobile device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device. Although you are not required to accept UDR’s Cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the UDR Services.</p>
<p>• You may opt out of receiving certain Cookies and certain trackers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;(NAI) opt out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;(DAA), or by installing the DAA’s AppChoice app&nbsp;on your mobile computing device. When you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from NAI or DAA member companies. If you delete Cookies on your computer, tablet or mobile computing device, you may need to opt out again. For information about how to opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices, you may consider third party sources such as Applicationprivacy.org. You will need to opt out of each browser and device for which you desire to apply these opt-out features.<br><br>• Even after opting out of Behavioral Advertising, you may still see UDR advertisements that are not interest-based&nbsp;(i.e., not targeted toward you).&nbsp;Also, opting out does not mean that UDR is no longer using Tracking Tools — UDR still may collect information about your use of the UDR Services even after you have opted out of Behavioral Advertising and may still serve advertisements to you via the UDR Services based on information it collects via the UDR Services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of Cookies and other Tracking Tools by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that some Cookies placed by third parties can continue to track your activities online even after you have left the UDR Services.</p>
<h3><strong>4.4.&nbsp;How UDR Responds to Browser “Do Not Track”&nbsp;(DNT)&nbsp;and Universal Opt-Out Preference Signals</strong></h3>
<p>Some web browsers&nbsp;(including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome)&nbsp;incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to web services that a visitor does not want to have their online activity and behavior tracked. &nbsp;Historically, there has not been consensus on what constitutes a DNT signal, so many web sites do not honor them, including this one.</p>
<p>New standards are being developed for a Universal Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), which allow users with GPC-enabled browsers and devices to send a signal that will communicate the user’s request to opt-out of sales of their personal information and to opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information.&nbsp; The CPRA and other laws allow for the acceptance of Opt-Out Preference Signals such as the GPC, as an option for users to transmit an Opt-Out of selling/sharing personal information.&nbsp; Our website is designed to recognize such a signal from your device or browser.&nbsp; As an alternative, if you wish to opt-out of the selling or sharing of your personal information for these purposes, please access the following link: <a href="/privacy-request/">DO NOT SELL/SHARE MY DATA. &nbsp;</a></p>
<h3><strong>5.&nbsp;How We Use Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>We may use information (including information that has been de-identified and/or aggregated) to better understand who uses the UDR Services and how we can deliver a better user experience.</p>
<p>We do not engage in automated decision making. We use information, including personal information, to provide the UDR Services and to help improve the UDR Services, to develop new services, and to advertise (for example, to display UDR ads on other web services). Specifically, such use may include:<br><br>• Providing you with the products, services and information you request, including services part of UDR’s “Lease Online” feature, which allows you access to online rent payment, schedule service or lease renewal;<br>• Connecting you to your chosen “Contact Community” profiles. ;&nbsp; <br>• Corresponding with you;<br>• Providing, maintaining, administering or expanding the UDR Services, performing business analyses, or for other internal purposes to support, improve or enhance our business, the UDR Services, and other products and services we offer;<br>• Sending you information about UDR or our products or the UDR Services;<br>• Combining information received from third parties with information that we have from or about you and using the combined information for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy;<br>• Showing you advertisements, including interest-based or online behavioral advertising;<br>• Providing you with access to other products or services that you may be interested in;<br>• Using statistical information that we collect in any way permitted by law, including from third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing efforts;<br>• Fulfilling our legally required obligations, such as preventing, detecting and investigating security incidents and potentially illegal or prohibited activities;<br>• Protecting against or deterring fraudulent, illegal, or harmful actions; and<br>• Enforcing our Privacy Policy and other agreements.</p>
<p>By providing your e-mail and/or phone number and checking a box, clicking the “complete” button, or some other affirmative act, you are consenting to receive e-mails and/or calls and text messages, including live, prerecorded, and/or automated calls and text messages and alerts, to that phone number. After signing up, you will receive a confirmation e-mail or text message from UDR on your mobile number. This agreement is not entered into as a term or requirement of any purchase or promotion. Normal message and data rates may apply. Message frequency may vary. Neither we nor the participating carriers guarantee that messages will be delivered.&nbsp; We may discontinue these programs at any time without notice.</p>
<h3><strong>6.&nbsp;How We Share Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, and in order to perform the UDR Services, we may share certain information, including sensitive personal information, that we collect from you, as described in this section:<br><br>• We may share your personal information with third parties that UDR believes will provide our customers with good and services that they may be interested in.&nbsp; This sharing may constitute a sale of your personal information. If you wish to opt-out of the selling or sharing of your personal information for these purposes, please access the following link <a href="/privacy-request/">DO NOT SELL/SHARE MY DATA</a>.<br>• We may share your personal information with third party service providers to facilitate administration of your lease. <br>• We may share your personal information with third party real estate properties about which information is provided on the UDR Services. <br>• We may share your personal information with our partners to customize or display our advertising.<br>• We may share your personal information and/or Traffic Data with our partners who perform operational services&nbsp;(such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage, security, insurance verification, web service analytics, or ad serving)&nbsp;and/or who make certain services, features or functionality available to our users.<br>• To determine if users have interacted with content across multiple devices and to match such devices, we work with partners who analyze device activity data and/or rely on your information&nbsp;(including demographic, geographic and interest-based data).&nbsp;To supplement this analysis, we also provide de-identified data to these partners. Based on this data, we may then display targeted advertisements across devices that we believe are associated or use this data to further analyze usage of the UDR Services across devices.<br>• We may transfer your personal information to another company in connection with a proposed merger, sale, acquisition or other change of ownership or control by or of UDR (whether in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.<br>• We also may need to disclose your personal information or any other information we collect about you if we determine in good faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1)&nbsp;comply with or fulfill our obligations under applicable law, regulation, court order or other legal process; (2)&nbsp;protect the rights, property or safety of you, UDR or another party; (3)&nbsp;enforce this Privacy Policy or other agreements with you; or (4)&nbsp;respond to claims that any posting or other content violates third-party rights.</p>
<h3><strong>7.&nbsp;Storage and Security of Information</strong></h3>
<p>Please note that any information you send to us electronically, while using the UDR Services or otherwise interacting with us, may not be secure when it is transmitted to us. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” Any information you send us through any means is transmitted at your own risk.</p>
<h3><strong>8.&nbsp;Your Choices</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>8.1 Information You Provide</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can always choose whether or not to provide personal information through the UDR Services. However, if you choose not to disclose certain personal information, you may not be able to register as a user of the UDR Services, which may limit your access to certain portions of the UDR Services. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights, including otherwise denying you goods or services, providing you with a different level or quality of services, or charging you different prices or rates for services.</p>
<h3><strong>8.2 Correcting Your Information</strong></h3>
<p>Visitors may correct or update their Personal Information at any time by emailing us at privacy@udr.com. Furthermore, upon your request, we will make reasonable efforts to remove your Personal Information from our active databases. To make this request, please submit a privacy request or call 1-844-204-7755. Such information will be corrected or deactivated as soon as reasonably possible. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes, or as required to comply with our legal obligations, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records.</p>
