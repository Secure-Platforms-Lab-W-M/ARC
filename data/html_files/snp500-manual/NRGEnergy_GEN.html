We allow our service providers to use Automatic Data Collection Tools for analytic and marketing purposes. Some of the Automatic Data Collection Tools we use are associated with your customer account and others are not. We may use “session cookies” (cookies that last until you close your browser) or “persistent cookies” (cookies that last until you or your browser delete them).</p><p>We also automatically collect Usage Information and other technical information about how you use and navigate our Website, apps or other online services, such as your IP address, equipment you use to access online services (such as a browser or mobile device), time of your use, what features are used, how long you spend on our online services and other “clickstream” information.</p><p>If you are concerned about the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, you may be able to direct your browser to reject cookies or to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent. You may also delete a cookie manually through your browser or other programs. If you are using a mobile or wireless device to access our Website, your mobile or wireless carrier may use cookies or unique identifier headers to transmit certain information about you to third parties. Contact your mobile or wireless carrier to change or opt out of such setting if possible. Note that some parts of our Website may not function properly or may not be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.</p><p>Online behavioral advertising is automated, customized advertising that you see when using online services, like ads in mobile Apps or on websites. Those ads are served to you based on inferences about your interests. Those interests are determined from data collected about you, whether by us or other parties. In addition, some content, or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies to collect information about you when you use our Website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services and they may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.</p><p>We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used, and we do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. If you do not wish to participate in interest-based advertising via third party advertising networks or to opt out of the use of certain tracking technologies, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp%20or%20http:/www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a> and follow the opt-out process.</p><p>Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference-based advertising purposes (referred to as “Do Not Track Signals” or “DNT Notice”). Unfortunately, given the lack of standardization among browsers and interest-based advertising technology, DNT Notices may not effectively accomplish this goal. For this and a variety of other reasons, with respect to our Website, we do not take any particular action based on browser based DNT Notices.</p><h3>How We Use Your Information</h3><p>We may use your information to provide you products and services and to manage and support our business functions, as follows:</p><ul><li>To fulfill your requests for products or services and to service your account.

If you receive such an email, it may be an attempted identity theft scheme that is commonly called “phishing,” where hackers steal your passwords or infect your computer with malicious software. If you are concerned about clicking links provided within an email sent by us, do not click the link. Instead, you should manually input our Website address in your preferred web browser. Doing so will ensure that you do not open a third-party website disguised to look like our Website.</p><p>For more information about “phishing,” and steps you can take to protect your Personal Information, please visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" title="This link will open a new window or tab depending on your browser settings.">www.ftc.gov</a>.</p><p><b>Children Under the Age of 13</b></p><p>Our Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age.
