			<p>American does not knowingly collect personal information directly from children – persons under the age of 13, or another age if required by applicable law – other than when required to comply with the law or for safety and security reasons. Due to the nature of our Services, we may collect travel information, which may include personal information, about children when it is required to comply with the law, including federal aviation or security regulations, as otherwise required to provide transportation needs and services, or for safety or security reasons.

We also use this information to verify that visitors meet the criteria required to process their requests and for reporting activity on our Services. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our Services or which pages or features get the most attention. This technical information may be combined with information that is personally identifiable in order to personalize our Services and advertising to your interests, including across browsers and devices. For example, if you spend time reviewing a particular flight or destination but do not complete a travel reservation, we may use this information to show you targeted advertising about similar flights or destinations on our Services or on third-party websites. Some of this information may be shared with third parties, as described in the section titled “Information collected by third parties on our Services.”</p>

			<p>A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to a user’s browser from a website’s computers and stored on a user’s computer’s hard drive, tablet, or mobile device. The cookie stores a small amount of data on your device about your visit to the Services. Some Cookies are “session cookies,” which expire at the end of the browser session and can capture your activities during the browser session. Other Cookies are “persistent cookies” which remain on your device for the period specified in the Cookie and are able to capture your settings or activities on multiple websites.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Cookies allow websites to recognize your browser or device during your use of our Services and some Cookies also allow us to track your behavior when you use the services (e.g., websites or apps) of other entities.</p>

					<h3>What Cookies do we use?</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
					<h4>1. Essential Cookies: </h4>
				
			
			
			<p>These Cookies enable you to use our Services. These Cookies are essential to enable you to browse our Services and use certain features you have specifically requested. Disabling them may prevent you from using certain parts of the Services. For example, without these Cookies, services such as shopping activity and paying activity cannot be provided. These types of Cookies allow us to:</p>
		
		

			
	

		
		

		
			
			

			
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
				
						
								
										
											<ul>
										
										
										
										
										
									
							
					
				
				
					
							<li>record that you are logged into your account;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>record when you give consent to our use of Cookies, when applicable; </li>
						
				
					
							<li>provide products and service to you and manage transactions, including enabling the Services you use to remember the items that you add to your shopping cart or the information you provided in forms;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>display the product reviews that you submit to us; and</li>
						
				
					
							<li>provide the necessary security the Services require, for example, to monitor traffic flow and visits in order to let us know of potential security threats (e.g., in case of unusually high or rapid traffic).</li>
						
								
				
				
						
								</ul>
							
					
			
							
			
	

		
			
			
			
			<p>We want you to understand these essential Cookies, and why we use them, but your consent is not required for us to use them as we use these Cookies only to provide you with services that you have requested.</p>
		
		

			
	

		
			
					<h4>2. Preference Cookies: </h4>
				
			
			
			<p>These Cookies store information such as your preferred country and language selection, AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> login data and website preferences. Without these Cookies, our Services may not be able to remember certain choices you've previously made (such as a saved country / language preference) or personalize your browsing experience by providing you with relevant information (such as saved reservation preferences or AAdvantage<sup>®</sup> award miles balance). These Cookies can recognize your device and offer you a more personal experience so that you do not have to provide the same information more than once. We also use these Cookies to enable you to comment on a discussion in a forum or provide enhanced services such as enabling you to view a video on our website. Disabling these Cookies means that you will be asked to reenter this information every time you use our Services.</p>
		
			
					<h4>3. Performance Cookies:</h4>
				
			
			
			<p>These Cookies collect information about how you use our Services such as which pages you visit regularly. They allow us to understand:</p>

							<li>which of our Services and their functions you use most often so that we can use this information to improve their functionality;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>your preferences to ensure that more relevant content (including advertising content) is delivered to you;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>page load and site response times; and</li>
						
				
					
							<li>if you get error messages.</li>
						
								
				
				
						
								</ul>
							
					
			
							
			
	

		
			
					<h4>4. Content / advertising Cookies: </h4>
				
			
			
			<p>These cookies gather information about your use of our Services so we may improve your experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising. They are also used to gather feedback on customer satisfaction through surveys. They remember that you've visited our Services and help us understand usage of our Services and tailor advertisements to you. These Cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Some of these Cookies are from third parties that collect information about users of our Services (as described in the section titled “Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising”) in order to provide advertising (on our Services and elsewhere) based on users’ online activities (so-called "interest-based advertising") on our Services and elsewhere online.</p>
		
		

			
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>Online behavioral advertising / interest-based advertising</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>Online behavioral advertising, also known as interest-based advertising, is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests. The third parties involved in interest-based advertising collect internet browsing information (e.g., websites visited, time of visit) across different websites and over time, and they may use the information they collect on our Services to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet. This may include anonymized or de-identified information about you, such as travel destinations that you search for while using our Services. These third parties may use the information they collect on our Services to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet (for example, travel products and services that are available at a destination you searched for online). Some of these third parties may participate in an industry organization that gives users the opportunity to opt out of receiving ads that are tailored based on online activities.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices, please opt out through the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative website and also through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. Your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising. If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests. American's websites do not honor web browsers' Do-Not-Track signals.</p>

			<p>Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive advertisements. Instead, the advertising you do see will likely be less relevant to your interests. Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.</p>
		
		

			
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>How to manage Cookies</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>If you do not wish to receive Cookies, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your device. You may also delete Cookies as soon as you leave the Services. Although you are not required to accept Cookies when you visit our Services, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionalities of the Services.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>For example, the Help portion of the toolbar on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when new Cookies are dropped, and how to entirely disable Cookies.

			<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information you provide to us.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>American uses reasonable technical, administrative, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, interference, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current. When your personal information is shared, American will take a reasonable approach to prevent the unauthorized use of personal information.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Please note, however, that while American attempts to safeguard your personal information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure, and thus we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
			
			
			
			<p>Here are some things you can do to keep your information secure.</p>
		
			
					<h4>Keep your record locator confidential:</h4>
				
			
			
			<p>When you make a booking, you will be given a 6-character record locator, also known as a Passenger Name Record (PNR). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your record locator confidential, as giving it to others may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others and do not want them to have access to your booking details, you should have each person make their own bookings.</p>
		
			
					<h4>Keep your AAdvantage® account number and login information confidential:</h4>
				
			
			
			<p>To make sure your access to our Services is secure; you should not share your log in details with anyone else. You should always log out of the Services after each use if others have access to your computer or device, especially if you are using a publicly accessible computer such as at a library or internet café.</p>

For example, American and other airlines comply with legal obligations in the United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK), member states of the European Union, Uruguay, Brazil (BR), and other countries to provide border control agencies and customs authorities with access to booking and travel data when you fly to and from such countries, including stopover or layover destinations or countries that you may overfly en route to your destination. American does not have control or knowledge of the storage and use of that data after it has been delivered to the respective government entity. Further, to the extent required by law, we may disclose personal information to government or law enforcement agencies, such as customs and immigration authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information to law firms and courts, as permitted by law, to enforce or apply a contract with you or protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our employees, our Services, or its users, including, without limitations, sharing personal data with public health authorities for purposes of combating infectious disease.</p>

			<p>The information of the data controller, and the Data Protection Officer of the data controller, is the following:</p>

											<ul>
										
										
										
										
										
									
							
					
				
				
					
							<li>you have given consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party, or in order to take steps at the request of you prior to entering into a contract;</li>
						
				
					
							<li>the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject; or</li>
						
				
					
							<li>the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by American Airlines or a third party, except when such interests are overridden by interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of our customers that require protection of personal data.</li>
						
								
				
				
						
								</ul>
							
					
			
							
			
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>Claims to the data protection authority of Ecuador</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>You may address the Ecuadorian Data Protection Authority (Superintendencia de Protección de Datos) and submit a claim, especially in cases where you deem that we have not satisfied your individual rights regarding how we process your personal information.</p>
		
		

			
	
	

						
					
						
						
							
							
	
	
			
					
				
		
	
			
					<h3>Your rights</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>You may be entitled to exercise the right to:</p>
		
		

			
	

		
		

		
			
			

			
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
													
				
				
						
								
										
											<ul>
										
										
										
										
										
									
							
					
				
				
					
							<li>object to the processing of Personal Data (for instance, where the basis of our processing is our legitimate interests, see section above “Lawfulness of processing”), and we will stop processing your data. We will not resume processing unless we can establish compelling legitimate grounds that override your rights.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data (for instance, this can be done if the Personal Data is not accurate and needs to be updated). This can also be done in relation to data where the purposes of processing no longer apply, but you still need the data and do not want us to erase it.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request updating of your Personal Data (if you believe the information we have about you is not accurate or incomplete). You may ask us to update your Personal Data but we cannot modify it for previously flown bookings because that is the official record of the transaction. For bookings made by a travel agent or through another airline, you must contact that other agency or airline directly to update or manage your Personal Data in the booking.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request access to your Personal Data (for instance, if you wish to receive a copy of your information, confirmation as to whether we are processing your information, and information as to how we use your information). You may request access to your Personal Data but that may not include information relating to others that you either did not provide to us or who have not consented to the disclosure of their information to you.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request erasure of your Personal Data (for instance, if we have no legal basis to process the information and you have not given us your consent to do so, if the purposes of processing no longer apply, or if you have objected to the processing and we cannot establish compelling legitimate grounds to override your rights). Certain data may not be erased if we have a requirement to retain it for legal purposes, or if we have a contract with you as a member of AAdvantage® or Business Extra (as we need to be able to perform contractual obligations owed to you). You may ask us to delete your Personal Data, but we cannot do so if you have a pending flight booked with us.</li>
						
				
					
							<li>request portability of your own Personal Data (the transfer of information you have provided to us, to another controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format), if such a request is technically possible to complete.</li>

					<h3>Legal basis for data processing</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process Personal Data includes processing that is:</p>
		
		

			
	

		
		

		
			
			

			
				
						<ul>
						
							<li>necessary for the performance of the contract between you and American (for example, to facilitate your travel on American under our conditions of carriage, to manage your membership in our loyalty programs, to provide you with other Services that you request, or for resolving billing or customer service inquiries related to your use of our Services);
								
							</li>
						
							<li>necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules, to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement or to ensure the safety of our Services);
								
							</li>
						
							<li>necessary for our legitimate interests to:
							
									<ul>				
									
										<li>manage our relationship with you, including to provide you with relevant information about your booked flight and travel destination; 
											
										</li>
									
										<li>improve the website and our Services, including by performing statistical studies or implementing analytics solutions (e.g., analytics cookies);
											
										</li>
									
										<li>provide marketing communications to you, some of which are personalized based on your interests. Depending on the nature of your relationship with American (i.e., whether you are an existing or prospect customer) the communications we send you and the applicable direct marketing rules, we process your Personal Data either based on your consent or based on our legitimate interest to promote our Services to you or those of our partners. You have the right to object to the use of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes at any time (see section “Your Rights” below); 
											
										</li>
									
										<li>ensure safety management, including to ensure the safety of our flights (to the extent not already mandated by legal requirements); and
											
										</li>
									
										<li>manage our disputes, prevent cases of fraud or comply with our legal obligations.
											
										</li>
									
									</ul>					
									
							</li>
						
							<li>to protect the vital interests of you or another person (for example, if we collect and process medical information in the event of a medical emergency and you are incapable of giving your consent);
								
							</li>
						
							<li>to perform a task carried out in the public or substantial public interest (for example, to provide disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunity for air travel comparable to those of other persons); and
								
							</li>
						
							<li>where legally required and we have no other valid legal basis to process Personal Data, we will use consent by our customers (for example, to provide you with marketing information or share information with third parties), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing privacy@aa.com) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
								
							</li>
						
						</ul>

					<h3>International transfers of personal data</h3>
				
		

	

		
			
			
			
			<p>The nature of American’s business means that the Personal Data collected through our Services will be transferred to the United States. Also, the American personnel and some of the third parties to whom we disclose Personal Data (as set out above) may be located in the United States and other countries outside of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or Uruguay, including in countries to which you fly and that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data remains protected and secure. More information and a copy of these clauses can be requested by emailing privacy@aa.com.</p>

					<h3>Your rights</h3>
