How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?</h2> <p>When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services.</p> <p>We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above.</p> <p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our Services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.</p> <p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.</p> <p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies, please review our <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/cookie-full" pa-marked="1">Statement on Cookies and Tracking Technologies</a> to learn more about our use of Cookies.

If you are a California resident, learn more about how we have handled your <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/ca-privacy-rights-full" pa-marked="1">Privacy Rights</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do you exercise your rights?</strong></p> <p>If you, or an authorized agent, want to exercise any of your rights relating to your Personal Information, <a href="#12" pa-marked="1"><strong>contact us</strong></a> or submit your request from your Account Settings. If you have an account, you can exercise your privacy rights by accessing “Data and Privacy” from Account Settings in the PayPal app.</p> <p>Even if you do not have an account (for example, where you use Payment without a PayPal account), you can submit a request for access, correction, or deletion of your information for your Payment without a PayPal account by contacting us at the number provided in the <a href="#12" pa-marked="1">Contact Us</a> section.</p> <p>If you or an authorized agent submit a request, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.</p> <p><strong>Your</strong><strong> right to request a copy of the Personal Information</strong>. If you want to make a request to know about the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices:</p> <ul> <li>Log in to your account and submit a request</li> <li>Call or contact us and request that we provide you with the data we’ve collected.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Your right</strong><strong> to correct your Personal Information:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Log in to your account and correct information you previously added. For example, you can edit your addresses in your settings</li> <li>Call or contact us and request that we correct specific information</li> </ul> <p><strong>Your right</strong><strong> to delete your Personal Information:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added. For example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings</li> <li>Call us or contact us and request that we delete specific information</li> <li>Close your account</li> </ul> <p>If you close your account or request that we delete Personal Information, we still need to keep some Personal Information as explained in <a href="#6" pa-marked="1">How long does PayPal store your Personal Information</a> section so we can:</p> <ul> <li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the user agreement or other contract you have with us</li> <li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li> <li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li> <li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our Services</li> <li>Comply with laws and other legal or governmental processes</li> </ul> <p>California also offers a right to opt out of “Selling” and “Sharing” Personal Information. Global Privacy Control setting is a browser setting that notifies website owners of users' privacy preferences regarding selling or sharing their personal information. PayPal does not respond to these settings because we do not sell or share data. Some Personal Information collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution are subject to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our <a href="#14" pa-marked="1"><strong>Consumer Privacy Notice</strong></a> for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p> <p><strong>Understanding your choices</strong></p> <p>You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we collect Personal Information</strong></p> <p>You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function at all.</p> <p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.</p> <p><strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use Personal Information</strong></p> <p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.</p> <p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.</p> <p><strong>Choose how we communicate with you</strong></p> <p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.</p> <p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device. You can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.</p> <p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for the Services, such as digital receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status. You may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, phone, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <a name="9" pa-marked="1"></a><h2>9. How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</h2> <p>We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and Account/profile registration information and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current.
