		<p>At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers how <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en/affiliated-company/">Apple or an Apple-affiliated company</a> (collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. </p>

		<p>At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. </p><p><b>To exercise your privacy rights and choices including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at </b><a href="https://privacy.apple.com">privacy.apple.com</a><b> for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam.</b> To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If you want to obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from <a href="https://privacy.apple.com">privacy.apple.com</a>, you can make a request at <a href="https://apple.com/legal/privacy/contact">apple.com/legal/privacy/contact</a>.</p><p>There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.</p><p><i>If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page</i>, you or your authorized agent can make a request at <a href="https://apple.com/legal/privacy/contact">apple.com/legal/privacy/contact</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-275-2273.</p><p>For more information on exercising your rights, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT208501">support.apple.com/kb/HT208501</a>. </p>

		<p>Apple uses personal data to power our services, to process your transactions, to communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations.

<li><strong>Power Our Services.</strong> Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting. For example, if you would like to access a song through an Apple Music subscription, we collect data on what songs you play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Process Your Transactions.</strong> To process transactions, Apple must collect data such as your name, purchase, and payment information.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate with You.</strong> To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback. From time to time, we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these important notices.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention.</strong> To protect individuals, employees, and Apple and for loss prevention and to prevent fraud, including to protect individuals, employees, and Apple for the benefit of all our users, and prescreening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Data Used for Personalization.</strong> If you choose to personalize your services or communications where such options are available, Apple will use information that we collect so that we can offer you those personalized services or communications. You can learn more about how relevant services use information to personalize your experience by reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data. We make this information easy to find by presenting it with our Data &amp; Privacy icon; it's also available at all times on your Apple device and online at <a href="http://apple.com/legal/privacy/data">apple.com/legal/privacy/data</a>.</li>

<p>Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the opportunity for human review. Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.</p>
<p><strong>Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law.</strong> We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service-specific privacy summaries. When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest possible period permissible under law.</p>
