    <h2>9.	PERSONAL DATA SUBMITTED BY CHILDREN </h2>

    <div>Some of the content on our Sites may be directed toward children under age 13. However, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under age 13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent or unless otherwise permitted by law, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law. If you believe that a child may have provided us with Personal Data without parental consent or otherwise not permitted by law, please contact us as detailed below in the “Contact Us” section.
    <br><br><u><i>California consumers </i></u>– We will not sell the information of California consumers who are 16 years old or younger without prior authorization. Our sites and services directed toward children will verify a user’s age and offer choices regarding the sale of personal information related to children aged 16 or younger.  If a California consumer is under 13 years old, a parent or guardian must consent to the sale of the minor’s personal information.  However, if the California consumer is between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, the minor may provide opt-in consent to the sale of their personal information.  Our sites directed toward children will ask for age verification and require appropriate consent.
    <br><br><u><i>EU Residents</i></u>– We do not collect or process personal data related to EU Data Subjects under the age of 16 without explicit consent from a parent or guardian.   Our sites directed toward children will ask for age verification and require consent as appropriate.

    <h2>10.	COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES </h2>
    <div>Our Sites use Cookies. Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.  Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device.  Cookies help with a variety of website functions including allowing users to “log in” to websites (making your navigation of websites more efficient), remembering your preferences (such as language), and generally improving your experience on our Sites.  Cookies can also help ensure that the advertisements and content you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.  We may also include web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.
    </div><br>
    <div>Some of our business partners set web beacons and Cookies on our site. In addition, third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring website addresses.  Further, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site.
        <br><br>If you would like to opt-out of cookies, visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org for further information.  These websites also tell you how to set your browser not to accept cookies and how to remove cookies from your browser.  However, in a few cases, some of the features on our Sites may not function as a result.  More information on our use of cookies can be found in our 
        <a href="cookie_en.html">Cookies Policy</a>.
    </div>

    <h2>11.	SECURITY</h2>
    <div>
        There is no perfect security.  We have implemented appropriate and commercially reasonable organizational, technical and administrative safeguards to protect Personal Data.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any credentials that can be used to access any account or service with Newell. If you should suspect any unauthorized activity please report this to us immediately.  You can report suspicious activity or other concerns by contacting us at:
        <br><br><a href="data-privacy-enquiry-form_en.html">Data Privacy Enquiry</a>
    </div>

    <h2>12.	LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</h2>
    <div>
        We may collect your information from third parties sites.  This includes when you log in through a third party site such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. We may also disclose information collected from third parties to customize ads and to manage and facilitate messaging on third party sites.  Please note that when you unsubscribe from our marketing email there may be a delay in the discontinuation of our ads directed to you on third party sites.  
    </div>
    <h2>13.	DO NOT TRACK</h2>
    <div>
        Newell does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.  However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.  If you are visiting such sites, you may be able to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.  
    </div>

    <h2>14.	USING MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES</h2>
    <div>
        Newell, our affiliates and third parties that we have engaged, may collect and store unique identifiers matched to your mobile device in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use our Sites, navigate the internet, to deliver location-based services and advertising, or to identify you in a unique manner across devices or browsers.  In order to customize these ads or content, we, or third parties, may collect Personal Data, e.g., your email address, or data passively collected from you such as your device identifier, location, or IP address.  Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.  
        <br>By adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device, you can manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information, as well as how your mobile browser handles Cookies and other tracking identifiers.  Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.
    </div>

    <h2>15.	EMAIL MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS </h2>
    <div>
        If you are an existing customer or, if required by applicable law, you have provided consent or have not otherwise directed us not to send you marketing messages, we may send you marketing messages via email and/or mail to keep you updated on our products and services.
        <br><br>You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time through the following methods:
        <ul>
          <li>Through your customer account settings/preferences within “My Account”;</li>
          <li>By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email communication we send you</li>
          <li>By contacting us at <a href="data-subject-request-form_en.html">Data Subject Request </a> </li>
        </ul>
        Once one of these methods is completed, we will honor your request and update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.
        <br><br>We will process opt-out/unsubscribe requests as quickly as possible, and in most cases, within 10 days.  However, Newell Brands is made up of a complex web of many inter-connecting companies and service providers so it may take time for all our systems to reflect these updates. We ask for your understanding that during this period you may still get messages from us while your request is being processed.  
        <br><br>Please note that the discontinuation of marketing messages will not stop any service communications such as order updates.
    </div>

    <h2>16.	TEXT MESSAGING </h2>
    <div>
        Our Sites may give you the choice to opt-in to receiving text messages and alerts on the mobile phone number(s) you have shared with us.  Once you have opted-in, we may send you text messages regarding your account, to investigate or prevent fraud, to alert you in the event of an emergency, etc.  We may send you text messages and alerts using autodialed technology.  Also, from time to time, we may run certain campaigns that provide you with the ability to send a text message to a specific short code and provide an opt-in to receive future text messages.  Your opt-in request provides us with your mobile phone number.  If you choose to opt-in, you agree that we may, from time to time, send messages to the mobile device associated with that number about new products, promotions, services, or offers. 
        <br><br>You may choose to opt-out from our text messages and alerts at any time by replying “STOP” to the message you received.  Once you opt-out, you will not receive any additional text messages via your mobile phone.  Please keep in mind that if you opt-out of receiving text messages and alerts we may not be able to contact you with important messages regarding your account or transactions with us.  However, if there is an emergency or account question, we will make every attempt to contact you in other ways such as by email or on a landline phone.  You do not have to opt-in to text messages and alerts to use our Sites and services.  If you opt-in, standard text messaging charges may apply.
