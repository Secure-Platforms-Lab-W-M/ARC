<p><strong>4. Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We and our partners work with third parties to display relevant advertising on our Website and to manage our advertising on other websites. In order to display relevant ads to you, these third parties may use cookies to collect browsing and activity information on our Website, on other websites, and across different devices, which may be linked with certain offline data they may also collect IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, general location information, and, where applicable, with your consent, your device’s geolocation information. These third parties may use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content. As a result, our ads may be displayed to you on a search results page or on other sites.</p>
