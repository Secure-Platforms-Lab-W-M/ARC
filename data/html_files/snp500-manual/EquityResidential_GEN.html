This may include, for example, when you fill out and submit forms (such as forms requesting information needed to consider you for apartment rentals or potential employment opportunities), when you initiate payments to us through the Web Site or otherwise, when you participate in promotions, contests, or sweepstakes, when you post to any interactive forum, bulletin board, chat room that we may make available on the Web Site, when you register for e-mail or <a href="https://www.equityapartments.com/sms-text-notifications" target="">SMS/text</a> communications, and when you submit a survey response, question or request to the Web Site using a form or the e-mail address links on the Web Site.</p>            <p>Information we and/or our service providers may collect may include: (1) Personal Information such as your first and last name, email address, phone number, address, and full payment account number; and (2) demographic information such as your gender, age, zip code, and interests.</p>            <h3>1.2 Passive Information Collection.</h3>            <p>When you visit the Web Site, we and/or our service providers may automatically collect certain information about your activities (“<b><b><i>Web Site Usage Information</i></b></b>”). Web Site Usage Information is information about your device, including browser and device identifiers such as IP address (“<b><b><i>Unique ID</i></b></b>”), and information about how our visitors use and navigate the Web Site. This includes, for example, the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays, the type of browser each visitor is using to view the Web Site (for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system each visitor is using, (for example, Windows 10, Mac OS X), the domain name of each visitor’s Internet service provider (for example, AT&amp;T, Charter, Comcast, Cox, Time Warner, Verizon), the visitor’s IP address and/or device ID, the address (or “<b><b><i>URL</i></b></b>”) of the web site that the visitor came from before visiting the Web Site, which pages were visited on the Web Site, what was clicked on, and certain other available information. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests. When you request pages from the Web Site, our servers log your IP address as well as information about your activities on those pages.</p>            <p>To collect this Web Site Usage Information, the Web Site and any e-mails sent to you by the Web Site (or otherwise by Equity Residential) may utilize<span>&nbsp;</span><b><b>cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts</b></b><span>&nbsp;</span>or other tracking technologies now and hereafter devised (“<b><b><i>Tracking Technologies</i></b></b>”).</p>            <p><b><b><i>Cookies</i></b></b>. A cookie is a small data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Web Site. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. To identify local shared objects on your computer and adjust your settings, please visit:<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_new">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.</p>            <p><b><b><i>Web Beacons</i></b></b>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs,” “Pixel Tags,” or “Web Bugs”) may be included in our Web Site’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Web Site, to monitor how users navigate the Web Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>            <p><b><b><i>Embedded Scripts</i></b></b>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Web Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Web Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>            <p><b><b><i>ETag, or Entity Tag</i></b></b>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at the URL ever chances, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of UID. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>            <p><b><b><i>Session Replay.</i></b></b>. Technology that monitors and records usage sessions to help usbetter understand, track and improve the usage of our Services.</p>            <p><b><b><i>Recognition Technologies</i></b></b>. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets which attempt to recognize or make assumption about users or devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user of household).</p>            <p>In addition,third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with the Web Site, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Web Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy regarding our practices do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.</p>            <p>Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals”. For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, though they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is not yet an industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted.</p>            <p>Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their Tracking Technologies practices associated with our Web Site. For example, you can find information on choices regarding analytics and interest-based advertising in Section 6 below. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties’ opt-out or other choice options. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (<a href="http://www.ghostery.com/" target="_new">Ghostery.com</a>), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. We are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool.</p>            <p>We offer a cookie consent preference tool <a href="#"><b>here</b></a>.

This may include offline collection, such as when you submit a paper application to rent an apartment, make a rent payment by check, or call or visit the management office at an Equity Residential property. It may also include e-mails that you send to us separate from the Web Site. This Privacy Policy also applies to Personal Information that you provide to us through means other than the Web Site. However, to the extent we combine the Personal Information we collect from you outside of the Web Site with Personal Information that we collect through the Web Site, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.</p>            <h3>1.4 Information Collected from Other Sources.</h3>            <p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources. For example, if you are applying for an apartment, condo, corporate housing, or employment, either via the Web Site or offline, we may obtain information from third parties about your creditworthiness, among other information, as part of the application process. We may combine the information we receive from these other sources with Personal Information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.</p>            <h3>1.5 Children.</h3>            <p>We are a general audience service and do not use the Web Site to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) that requires parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<b><b><i>COPPA</i></b></b>”) without such parental consent. If you are a child under thirteen (13) years of age, you are not permitted to use the Web Site and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Web Site.</p>            <p>In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information, or otherwise treat it, in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations.

Some information about your browsing of the Web Site and certain Third Party Services may be collected across time and services shared with third parties to deliver ads and/or other content to you on the Web Site and certain Third Party Services. Equity Residential may receive information about Third Party Services that you have visited and use if for marketing purposes – a practice sometimes termed “(re)-targeting,” “interest-based advertising,” and “online behavioral advertising,” (collectively, “<b><b><i>Interest-based Ads</i></b></b>”). We may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display Interest-based Ads to you on Third Party Services. These entities may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as registering a unique identifier for your device and tying that to your online activities on and off of the Web Site.</p>            <p>Certain companies we work with to serve Interest-based Ads participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<b><b><i>DAA</i></b></b>") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads on the ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.youradchoices.com/" target="_new">http://www.youradchoices.com/</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and its opt-out program for mobile apps at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_new">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges we work with to serve Interest-based Ads may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“<b><b><i>NAI</i></b></b>”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Please be aware that even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-bases Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, opting out of one of more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA/NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This selective opting out will affect this Web Site and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI/DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile devices opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device.
