<span>We collect your personal information in order to provide products and services to you, to communicate with you, to enhance our products, services, and operations, and for other operational, legal and compliance purposes. Below are some examples of personal information we collect:</span></span><ul><li><span><span><b>Identification information</b>&nbsp;that can be used to identify you, such as your name, alias, address, phone number, or email address. We may also collect online identifiers, such as your IP address, when you browse our websites or use our applications. We may collect government-issued ID for certain types of transactions — but please provide government-issued ID information only if we ask you to.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Transactional or commercial information</b>,&nbsp;such as products or services you purchased or considered purchasing. We may also collect your payment card information when you complete a transaction.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Online activities information</b>,&nbsp;such as browsing history, search history, and other information when you interact with our websites, applications, and advertisements.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Geolocation data,</b>&nbsp;including precise geolocation data if you allow our application to collect it.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Audio, electronic, or visual information</b>,&nbsp;such as audio or video recording when you call us or when you come to our stores, but please note we may not be able to associate such recordings with you.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Demographic information</b>,&nbsp;such as age, gender and family status.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Inferences or preferences</b>&nbsp;we learn or infer about you.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span>Other information about you, such as professional or employment-related information, or education information, when you provide us the information in a survey.</span></span></li></ul><span><span><b>We do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information from youth or children under the age of 18 without parental or guardian consent.</b>&nbsp;If a youth or child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us so that the information can be deleted.<br></span></span><span><span><br></span>

</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2>What Are the Sources of Your Information</h2></div><div>

<span><span>We collect different types of information about you from a number of sources, including information you provide to us, information we automatically collect, information we obtain from other sources (specified below), and information we derive or infer about you.</span></span><ul></ul>

</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>Information You Provide</h3></div><div><span>

<span>You may choose to provide us with information when you interact with us. Examples include:</span></span><ul><li><span><span><b>Identification information.</b>&nbsp;You may provide your contact information, such as name, address, and phone number in case we need to reach out to you, such as arranging delivery or pickup. You may also set up your login and access credentials if you become a registered user of our websites. To complete transactions, we may collect your payment information and signatures. You can also provide your contact information, such as email, address, or phone number to receive promotional messages from us. If you apply for a charge account (as opposed to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.lowes.ca/about/privacy-policy#section--7-6"><span><span>private-labelled credit cards</span></span></a><span><span>, see below) available at RONA stores or some of the Reno-Depot and Lowe’s stores, we may request additional information such as your date of birth, income, and asset information to evaluate your application. RONA solely makes credit decisions and manages these charge accounts.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Transactional or commercial information.</b>&nbsp;You may provide or generate commercial information regarding your Lowe’s Canada purchases, returns, exchanges, warranties, and rebates.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Demographic information.</b>&nbsp;You may provide your demographic information, including age, gender, marriage, and family status, such as when you complete a survey from us.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Your preferences and inferences.</b>&nbsp;You may let us know your preferences in a survey, contest, promotion or sweepstakes, or other content you submit, such as product reviews.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Professional, educational employment-related information.&nbsp;</b>You may also provide other professional, educational, or employment-related information when you respond to our surveys.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Other personal information,</b>&nbsp;such as your medical and insurance information, which may be provided in the unlikely event you are injured and/or your property is damaged while at our location or as a result of any services and/or products we have provided to you. In such circumstances, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Statement, we will only use such information for the purpose of assessing and administering your injury or loss and any resulting claim and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.</span></span></li></ul>

</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>Information Collected by Automated Means</h3></div><div><span>

<span>We collect information by automated means online and offline. When you use our websites or mobile applications, Lowe’s Canada and our partners may collect certain information by using&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.lowes.ca/about/privacy-policy#section--7"><span><span>Cookies and Other Technologies</span></span></a><span><span>. If you choose to connect your mobile device to our free in-store Wi-Fi, we may collect your device usage information. When you visit our store or call our customer care hotline, we may collect audio or video information.</span></span><ul></ul><span><span>We collect the following information via automated means:</span></span><ul><li><span><span><b>Identification information,</b>&nbsp;such as your IP address, device ID, cookie ID, mobile advertising identifier, or pixel identifier.</span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Online activities,</b>&nbsp;such as browse and search history, interactions with our websites, applications, clickstreams, or other information about your online interactions.</span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Geolocation data.</b> With your consent, we may collect certain information about your precise location through our mobile applications when it is in use to help you locate the nearest Lowe’s Canada store or for analytic purposes. Lowe’s Canada may compare the geographic information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected when you visit our website to derive a general geographic area in order to provide you with information or promotions relevant to your geographic area.</span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Audio, video, or electronic information,</b>&nbsp;such as audio or video (if we engage in video chats with you) recording of the conversations with you when you contact our customer service centers or other support lines which are used for quality control, training, security and analytic purposes. We may also use video monitoring and other tracking technologies at Lowe’s Canada stores to enhance security, protect against theft and other crimes and to monitor in-store traffic patterns, customer counts and interests, and perform similar analytics. Since video recordings capture all activities occurring within a store, it may not be feasible to associate video recordings with you.</span></span></li></ul>

</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3></div><div>

<ul><li><span><span><b>Identification information.&nbsp;</b>We may collect your contact information from Lowe’s Canada affiliates, acquired businesses, business partners, public sources, or other individuals, such as through “Refer a Friend” programs or if someone purchases a product and asks that it be delivered to you.<br><br></span></span></li><li><span><span><b>Transactional or commercial information.&nbsp;</b>We may obtain your commercial information, such as your purchase history, from Lowe’s Canada affiliates, acquired businesses, or business partners.

We may collect inferences or preference information about you from business partners, such as data analytics or survey vendors. We may use such information to conduct aggregated analyses of our customer composition, and we may collect your interest and preference information to recommend products or services that may interest you. We may also learn about your preferences from public sources, such as information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a customer review).<br><br></span></span></li></ul><h3><br></h3>
