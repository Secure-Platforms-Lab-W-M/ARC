<p><span>Certain jurisdictions permit a consumer to designate an Authorized Agent to submit a disclosure or deletion request on behalf of the individual. To respond to a request from an Authorized Agent, we may:</span></p>

<ul><li><span>Request a copy of the written permission, such as a power of attorney or registration with the applicable government agency, granting the Authorized Agent to make such a request on the individual’s behalf; and</span></li>
	<li><span>Verify the identity of the individual as described below.</span></li>

<p><span>We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access, and to provide you with the personal data that we hold about you or make your requested changes.

If this happens, we will reach out to you directly with this request.<span>&nbsp; </span>We may not be able to comply with your request if we are unable to confirm your identity or connect the information you submit in your request with personal information in our possession.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span>Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some, or all, of the personal data that we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal data anonymous in accordance with our data retention obligations and practices.
