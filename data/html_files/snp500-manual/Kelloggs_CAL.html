<p>We do use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes to which the right to limit use and disclosure applies under the CCPA.</p>
<p>We also collect some Personal Information that does not directly fit within one of the categories defined by the CCPA. For example, we collect the contents of communications you send to us and language preference. Unless otherwise specified, the sources of this Personal Information, the purposes for which we use it, and the categories of persons to which we disclose it are the same as those listed for Identifiers.</p>
<p><b>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>We keep the categories of Personal Information described above for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Notice or otherwise authorized by law. This generally means holding the information for as long as one of the following apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information;</li>
<li>Your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which the Personal Information was collected;</li>
<li>The information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property (which will generally relate to applicable laws that limit actions in a particular case); or</li>
<li>We are otherwise required or permitted to keep your information by applicable laws or regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where information is used for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires. For more information about our retention policies, please contact us using the contact details below.</p>
<p><b>2. HOW WE SHARE AND SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>Under California law, a “sale” of Personal Information does not necessarily involve an exchange of money. Instead, the term also includes disclosures of Personal Information to third parties that may use the information for their own purposes, such as cookie providers. Similarly, under California law, “sharing” Personal Information refers to disclosing of Personal Information to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. In this context we sell and/or share and, during the last twelve (12) months, may have sold and/or shared the following categories of Personal Information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers</li>
<li>Personal Information described in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e)</li>
<li>Characteristics of protected classifications</li>
<li>Commercial information</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
<li>Geolocation data</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information</li>
<li>Inferences</li>
<li>Sensitive Personal Information</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The categories of recipients to whom we may have sold and shared Personal Information include our vendors and other third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising, as well as other marketing and advertising services that we utilize on our digital properties. We only “sell” Personal Information to third parties as defined in the CCPA for the purposes of cookies or other tracking technologies. We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the Personal Information of consumers under 16 years of age.</p>
