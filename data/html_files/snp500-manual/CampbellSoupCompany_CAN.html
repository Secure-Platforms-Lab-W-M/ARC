For example, we reserve the right to and may disclose your information in response to requests from local, provincial/territorial or federal law enforcement officials; any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as a subpoena; to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, physical threats or other violations of our Site policies or the rights of third parties; or to investigate any suspected misconduct.</p>



<p>We may also share your information in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale or reorganization or the potential thereof, including with our successors in business and purchasers of Site assets, or with our parent or affiliate companies for corporate reporting.</p>



<p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>



<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have undertaken commercially reasonable efforts to help prevent unauthorized access to the visitor data we retain, including implementing physical, organizational and technological safeguards. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law.</p>



<p>However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. By using our Sites, you accept all risks associated with any data transmission, including the risk that your information may be intercepted in transit and agree that we will not be liable for disclosures of your information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>



<p><strong>INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</strong></p>



<p>We may allow third parties to use cookies and other online tracking tools to better understand your behavior and browsing activities, so that we can serve you targeted advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”) while on our Sites and display our ads to you when you visit other sites. These third parties may passively collect information with these tools so that content specific to your interests can be delivered to you online. To learn more about interest-based advertising, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca"><strong>www.youradchoices.ca</strong></a>. To manage your preferences or opt-out of interest-based advertising, please visit &nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>www.youradchoices.ca/choices</strong></a> or use the preferences tool by clicking the <a href="//l3.evidon.com/pub_info/16910?v=1&amp;nt=0&amp;nw=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AdChoices</strong></a>, also found at link at the footer of our relevant Sites.</p>



<p>You can prevent your receipt of interest-based ads by deleting and declining cookies in your browser. If you block cookies, certain features on our Sites may not work. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.&nbsp; If you elect to opt-out of interest-based advertising, you may still see ads, but they may not be relevant to you.&nbsp; Note that opting out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific device and browser on which the opt out cookie is applied.&nbsp; If you delete your browser cookies or if you use a different computer or different browser and want to continue to be opted out of interest-based advertising, you will need to opt-out again. </p>



<p>Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our Sites do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals. </p>



<p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES</strong></p>



<p>Our Sites may provide you with the ability to register, log on to, “like” or otherwise interact with social media services, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest or YouTube. We do not control these social media services or your profiles on these services, and we do not establish privacy settings or rules for how your information on such services will be used. If you choose to log on to or submit information through any of these social media services, your information will be subject to the applicable social media service’s privacy policy. You are encouraged to read such policy to learn more about how the social media service will handle your information. By accessing any social media service, you will be assuming the all risks that the information you provide on that service may be viewed and/or used by the social media service or third parties. You agree that we are not responsible for any acts or omissions by these social media service providers and/or third parties.</p>



<p><strong>OPTING OUT OF COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>



<p>You may exercise your opt-out rights to stop receiving our promotional communications by:</p>



<ul><li>Clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the footer of any promotional electronic message from us and following the on-screen directions. If you created an online account with us, you may log-in to the applicable Site and make changes to your communications preferences. We may still need to contact you for administrative or transactional purposes.</li><li>You may also contact us as provided below under&nbsp;<a href="http://www.campbellsoupcompany.com/connect-with-campbell/"><strong>Contact Us&nbsp;﻿</strong></a>to make your opt-out request. Be sure to specify the Site and how you want to change, update or limit our use of your information.</li></ul>



<p>We will endeavor to accommodate your requests in our own databases as soon as we can reasonably do so. </p>



<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>



<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections for children. While our Sites designed for a Canadian audience are intended for adults, certain affiliate Sites may be directed to children. This Children’s Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 if and when any such Site is directed to children. </p>



<p><strong>What We Collect From Children and How We Use It</strong></p>



<p>We do not require children to share any personal information in order to participate on our child-directed Sites. Children can surf, view content, play games and enjoy many features of our child-directed Sites without providing any personal information. If a child wants to use a Site for special activities, like earning badges, we may ask the child to “join” the Site. A child can join the Site anonymously by providing us with a username and password. On our child-directed Sites with the ability to enter a user name, we advise children not to provide any personal information in their username.</p>



<p>On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address, from children as part of an activity. For example:</p>



<ul><li> <strong>Email address:</strong> We may collect a child’s email address via our child-directed Sites in order to respond to a one-time request from the child, such as if the child asks us a question. In this case, we delete the child’s email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the child’s email address for any other purpose.</li><li> <strong>Send-a-friend:</strong> In the case of send-a-friend card or email service via our child-directed Sites, we may collect the friend’s email address to send the card/email. We do not store the friend’s email address for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the card/email.</li><li> <strong>Contests or Sweepstakes:</strong> We may collect a child’s email address to enter the child in a sweepstakes or contest via our child-directed Sites, and then use this email address to notify the child that he or she has won or lost that sweepstakes or contest. For certain promotions, we may require that a child give us his/her parent/legal guardian’s email address so we can obtain more information from the parent for prize fulfillment purposes; to tell the parent/legal guardian whether the child has registered in a promotion; or to notify and obtain consent from the parent/legal guardian if we need to collect more than a child’s email address to enter the child in the promotion.</li></ul>



<p>We will not collect other personal information from a child, such as a postal address or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent is required, we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the consent of the parent or guardian. We will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in and operate that activity.</p>



<p>We may also collect information using automated tools solely to support the Site’s internal operations, including maintaining, securing, and analyzing the functioning of the Site. For example, we may collect this information to recognize returning visitors, understand and monitor usage of the Site, customize content on the Site, and otherwise improve performance of the Site. We do not permit interest-based advertising on our Sites directed to children.</p>



<p><strong>Special Circumstances for Information Sharing and Platform Security</strong></p>



<p>We may share a child’s personal information with third parties if we are required to do so by law or to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our Sites; take precautions against liability; or to respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities. We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for us. These services may include hosting our Sites, providing other technical services to us, fulfilling requests, or administering promotions. Such vendors are obligated to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them. We may also share personal information if CSC reorganizes or transfers ownership, including with those who may purchase our Site assets, or with other parts of the company for corporate reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Parents Rights</strong></p>



<p>Parents have the right to review and have their child’s personal information deleted from our records. Parents also have the right to tell us to stop collecting or using their child’s personal information. To exercise these options, parents may email, call, or write to us via the information listed in the&nbsp;<a href="http://campbellsoupcompany.com/connect-with-campbell/">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;section below. Please reference “Child Information Request.”</p>



<p><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong></p>



<p><strong>Accessing and Correcting your Information</strong></p>



<p>You may request access to your personal information and request a correction to it if you believe it is inaccurate. If you have submitted personal information to us and would like to have access to it, or if you would like to have it removed or corrected, please contact us using the contact information provided below. We may verify your identity before providing you with access to your personal information. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request; however, in some cases we may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in certain circumstances, for example, if it contains personal information of other persons or for legal reasons. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why it is not possible to grant access to your personal information. </p>



<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>



<p>Our Sites may contain links to other sites, including to those of our affiliates or third party entities that may contain a different privacy statement. These sites may also refer you back to our Sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements of each site you visit to understand the site’s privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of sites operated by third parties.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy Policy Modifications</strong></p>



<p>We reserve the right to modify or replace this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any such modifications. We will indicate below the date we last updated this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.</p>



<p><strong>International Transfers of Information</strong></p>



<p>This Site is maintained in the United States of America. By using this Site, you authorize the export of your personal information to the USA, and/or other countries outside of your jurisdiction of residence and its storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy in such countries. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
