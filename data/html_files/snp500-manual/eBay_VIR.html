You may also request access to such personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Correct.</strong> Subject to certain exceptions, you have the right to request that we rectify, correct, or update your personal data held by us that is inaccurate.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Delete.</strong> Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to request that we delete the personal data that we hold about you. We may refuse your right to delete if it is reasonably necessary for us to provide a service requested by you; to perform a contract between us; to maintain functionality and ensure security of our systems; to enable solely expected internal uses of your personal data; to exercise a right provided by law; or to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Opt Out of Sale.</strong> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Opt Out of Targeted Advertising.</strong> You may have the right to opt-out of processing of your personal data for purposes of targeted advertising based on your activity across non-affiliated websites, applications, and online services. Like many online marketplaces, we use cookies, pixels, and similar technology, and we share certain information, such as your IP address or device identifiers, to certain third-party advertisers in order to improve your user experience and to optimize our marketing activities. Please note that you may still receive generalized ads after opting out of targeted advertising and your eBay experience may still be personalized based on your eBay activity.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Opt out of Profiling.</strong> Virginia users have the right to opt-out of “profiling,” which VCDPA defines as solely automated processing of personal data to make certain decisions with a legal or similarly-significant effect on you (such as employment decisions, credit decisions, and access to basic goods and services). eBay does not engage in profiling as described above.</li>
<li><strong>Right Against Discrimination.</strong> You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. We will not discriminate against you for exercising or requesting to exercise your rights.&nbsp;</li>
