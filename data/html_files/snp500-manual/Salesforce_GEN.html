<p><b>4.2 Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our website and in email communications</b></p>
<p>We use technologies such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and JavaScript, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to gather information about the use of our websites and how people interact with our emails.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites, we, or an authorized third party, may place a cookie on your device that collects information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites. Cookies allow us to track use, infer browsing preferences, and improve and customize your browsing experience.</p>
<p>We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites. Session-based cookies exist only during a single session and disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off the device. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser or turn your device off. To change your cookie settings and preferences for one of our websites, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page. You can also control the use of cookies on your device, but choosing to disable cookies on your device may limit your ability to use some features on our websites and services.</p>
<p>We also use web beacons and pixels on our websites and in emails. For example, we may place a pixel in a marketing email that notifies us when you click on a link in the email. We use these technologies to operate and improve our websites and marketing emails. – please see more details in the “Advertising Cookies” row in the table below. For instructions on how to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please see Section 10.4 below.</p>
<p>The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies and your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:</p>

<p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.</p>
</td>

<td valign="top"><p>Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the website. Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.</p>
<p>We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.</p>
<p>Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.</p>

<p>We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.</p>
<p>Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting certain data through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use. When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request.</p>

	<p><b>4.3 Notices on behavioral advertising and opt-out for website visitors</b></p>
<p>As described above, we or one of our authorized partners may place or read cookies on your device when you visit our websites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”). To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks, please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the Digital Advertising Alliance, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>. To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce Audience Studio, click <a href="/products/marketing-cloud/sfmc/salesforce-dmp-consumer-choice/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>To manage the use of targeting and advertising cookies on this website, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page or consult your individual browser settings for cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118" target="_blank">here</a>. Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4.4 Opt-Out from the setting of cookies on your individual browser</b></p>
<p>In addition to using the user preference center, in many cases you may opt-out from the collection of non-essential device data on your web browser (see Section 4.1 above) by managing your cookies at the browser or device level. In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, click <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a> (or, if located in the European Union or United Kingdom, click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">here</a>).&nbsp; To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce Audience Studio, click <a href="/products/marketing-cloud/sfmc/salesforce-dmp-consumer-choice/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the websites.</p>
<p>While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<p><b>4.5 Social Media Features</b></p>
<p>Our websites may use social media features, such as the “Tweet” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.</p>
<p>Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.</p>
<p>Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.</p>
<p><b>4.6 Telephony log information</b></p>
<p>If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers).</p>

	<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act) requires businesses to disclose whether they sell or share Personal Data. As a business covered by the CCPA, we do not sell Personal Data.&nbsp; We may share Personal Data (in the form of identifiers and internet activity information) with third party advertisers for purposes of targeting advertisements on non-Salesforce websites, applications and services. In addition, we may allow third parties to collect Personal Data from our sites or services if those third parties are authorized service providers who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such Personal Data, or if you use Salesforce sites or services to interact with third parties or direct us to disclose your Personal Data to third parties.</p>
<p>California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Data that we disclose for certain “business purposes,” such as to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products, and to such other entities as described in Sections 5 and 6 of this Privacy Statement. We disclose the following categories of Personal Data for our business purposes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers;</li>
<li>Commercial information;</li>
<li>Internet activity information;</li>
<li>Financial information;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Professional and employment-related information;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Education information;</li>
<li>Geolocation data;</li>
<li>Audio and visual data;</li>
<li>In limited circumstances where allowed by law, information that may be protected characteristics under California or United States law; and</li>
<li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>California law grants state residents certain rights, including the rights to know and access specific types of Personal Data, to learn how we process Personal Data, to request deletion of Personal Data, to request correction of Personal Data, to opt-out of sharing your Personal Data for third party advertising purposes, and not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our website(s). Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For information on how to exercise your rights, please refer to Section 10.2 of this Privacy Statement. If you are an authorized agent wishing to exercise rights on behalf of a California resident, please contact us using the information in the “Contacting Us” section above and provide us with a copy of the consumer’s written authorization designating you as their agent.</p>
<p>If you would like to opt-out of shares using your cookie identifiers, turn on a Global Privacy Control in your web browser or browser extension. Please see the California Privacy Protection Agency’s website at https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa for more information on valid Global Privacy Controls.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out of shares using other identifiers (like email address), please refer to Section 10.2 of this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>We may need to verify your identity and place of residence before completing your rights request.&nbsp;</p>
