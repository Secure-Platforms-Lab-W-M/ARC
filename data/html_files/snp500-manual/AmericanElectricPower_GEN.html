        <h2>Notice for California Residents</h2>
        <p>Certain national and state privacy laws provide rights for individual consumers. Under California law, for instance, a California resident has the right to request that the business disclose what personal information it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. AEP has endeavored to do that with this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <h3>Rights</h3>
        <p>Under California law, we cannot discriminate against you because you exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act. </p>
        <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information. To do so, you may visit our <a href="https://www.aep.com/donotsell">online form</a> or you can broadcast a global privacy control opt-out signal that will alert us you have opted out of the sale or sharing or your personal data.</p>
        <p>
            We collect very limited sensitive personal information about you as a consumer.  As noted above, we may collect health information as necessary to provide you with additional protections as our utility customer.
            We also may collect your social security number, drivers’ license number, state identification card number, or passport number to confirm your account and validate your identity.
            We do not sell or share this information with anyone unless necessary to fulfill your requested utility service or protect your personal health and safety.
            We may also collect certain demographic information about you in order to market additional services to you that would be of potential interest. You may request that we limit the use or disclosure of your sensitive personal information by visiting <a href="https://www.aep.com/donotsell">our website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind, because AEP is a public utility service provider, we may not be able to delete information that is reasonably necessary for us to provide you with utility service and other services that are reasonably anticipated as part of that relationship.
            We also may not be able to delete information necessary to comply with our legal obligations, fulfill the terms of our agreements with you, or enable internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the reasonable expectations of customers of AEP.
            Please refer to California Civil Code § 1798.105 for a detailed explanation of exceptions to the right to delete.
