In the course of business, we may need to share your Personal Information.<br>&nbsp;<br>We may use your Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, government or law enforcement requests, court orders or otherwise as required by law. We may disclose information when appropriate and necessary in order to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;We may also share information about you with our third parties as follows:<br>&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li> 
      <span>To protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service or any third party;</span></li><li> 
      <span>With our affiliates for internal business purposes;</span></li><li> 
      <span>With our subsidiaries, affiliates, business partners, and other third parties for their own business purposes; and</span></li><li>

<h3>Information you disclose publicly or to others​</h3><p>The Service may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “User Content”), on platforms such as blogs and forums, and in association with your account and user profile.&nbsp; We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you.&nbsp; Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties.&nbsp; Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content.&nbsp; Please note that CenterPoint Energy does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Service or what others do with information you share with them on the Service.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.&nbsp; We are not responsible for User Content you submit to third party services via our Service.<br></p><h3>Data Security​</h3><p>We have put administrative, technical and physical safeguards in place to help protect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Access to your information is limited to employees who need it for a business purpose. Or, during the course of business, if your Personal Information is shared with outside contractors, there are provisions in our contracts with them to safeguard your information, as appropriate. We can’t promise that our security measures will never be defeated or fail, and unfortunately no electronic transmission of information is entirely secure.<br></p><h3>Where we operate our Service​​</h3><p>Our Service is governed by applicable U.S. laws. When you provide Personal Information to us, we may process it in the U.S. or outside of the country in which you are located.&nbsp; Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br></p><h3>Links to other websites​​</h3><p>Our Service may provide links to independent, third-party websites, locations, platforms or services. Even though we provide links to other websites, we are not responsible for the content found on those websites, and they may have their own privacy policies regarding collecting and sharing Personal Information.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Social Media Features​</h3><p>Our Service provides social media features that let you share our information and interact with us through social networks. Using these features may result in us collecting or sharing information about you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Social media networks operate independently from CenterPoint Energy. We are not responsible for their interfaces, privacy or security practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites you use so you can understand how they operate.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you access our Service through social media platforms (like Facebook), we may access and store information through an interface provided by the platform. We collect this information in accordance with social networks’ terms of use or terms of service.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Advertising, Analytics Services, and Online Tracking​​</h3><p>We may engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf on the Service and/or on third-party services and to provide analytics services about the use of our Service and the performance of our ads and content on third-party services. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Service visitors, on our Service and on third-party services and off of our Service, based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain third-party services. These entities may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as registering a unique identifier for your device and tying that to your online activities on and off of our Service.&nbsp; We may use this information to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and third-party services and better understand your online activity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Some information about your browsing of the Service and certain third-party services may be collected across time and services and shared with third parties to deliver ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain third-party services. CenterPoint Energy may receive information about Third-Party Services that you have visited and use it for marketing purposes—a practice sometimes termed “(re)-targeting,” “interest-based advertising,” and “online behavioral advertising.”&nbsp; Data collected from a particular browser or device may be used with another computer or device that is linked to the browser or device on which such data was collected or transferred to a non-affiliate for such purposes.<br>&nbsp;<br>We are not responsible for third parties or third-party services associated with advertising and analytics services and related tracking activities.&nbsp; Consult their privacy policies and notices for information on their practices and see “Unsubscribe to email messages” below regarding certain choices some of them may offer you.<br></p><h3>“Do not track” signals​</h3><p>While your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit, like many companies, we do not alter our practices when we receive these signals.

   <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.<br></p><h3>Children’s Privacy​​</h3><p>While our Service is not intended for children younger than age 13, on occasion we may provide features for children such as educational videos or online games that teach about science and energy. Those pages do not ask for personal information, and we do not knowingly collect it from children younger than age 13. If you know that a child has submitted personal information to us, please send an email or letter regarding the situation, and we will delete it from our records.<br></p><h3>Access​</h3><p>Our online tools make it easy to manage your contacts and Personal Information.&nbsp; Log in or sign up for My Account to review, update or add contact details and bill reminders and alert preferences. You may also email us at 
   <a href="/en-us/CustomerService/Pages/CNP_Forms/Contact-Customer-Service.aspx">Centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/contact-us/</a>​.<br></p><h3>Unsubscribe to email messages​</h3><p>You can tell us not to send you promotional emails by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the emails you receive from us.&nbsp; Doing so will not prevent us from sending you transactional emails such as billing, account-related, regulatory or safety emails, but it does mean that you will not learn about CenterPoint Energy products or services as soon as they are announced.<br>&nbsp;<br>You may re-subscribe for emails at any time by contacting Customer Service. It typically takes ten business days to process subscription requests.<br></p><h3>Opt out of receiving targeted advertising​</h3><p>Certain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting.&nbsp; You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at ouradchoices.com and its opt-out program for mobile applications at aboutads.info/appchoices.&nbsp; In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain targeted advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, visit networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases (“Matched List Ads”).&nbsp; This is done by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of third-party operators.&nbsp; For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Google, Facebook, or Twitter. If we use Google to serve Matched List Ads, you can opt out by emailing us at 
   <a href="/en-us/CustomerService/Pages/CNP_Forms/Contact-Customer-Service.aspx">Centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/contact-us/</a>​.&nbsp; If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt out with us from such list. If we use Twitter Matched List Ads, you should be able to opt out through your account settings on Twitter.&nbsp; If you opt out from our Google Matched List Ads, Facebook Matched List Ads, or Twitter Matched List Ads, you will be removed from that respective list; however, this will not take effect immediately. and if you have multiple emails or other accounts, you may have to opt out separately for each one.&nbsp; We are not responsible for such third-party services’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions or to provide us notice of your opt-out elections, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.<br></p><h3>Contact Us​</h3><p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like us to update information we have about you, please email us at<br><a href="/en-us/CustomerService/Pages/CNP_Forms/Contact-Customer-Service.aspx">Centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/contact-us/</a>​.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or write to us at:<br>CenterPoint Energy, Inc.<br>Attn: Privacy Policy Administration<br>P.O.
