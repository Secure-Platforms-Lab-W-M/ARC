Fulfilling these purposes may include transferring your personal data to third parties as outlined in Section 3 below.</p><h3>2. What is the legal justification for processing your personal data and what happens if you choose not to provide your personal data?</h3><p>We rely on the following legal grounds for the collection, processing, and use of your personal data:</p><ul><li>the processing is necessary to provide the Website and its services to you;</li><li>your consent to the processing of your data for one or more specific purposes; </li><li>the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract;</li><li>the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;</li><li>the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of you which require protection of personal data; such legitimate interests are the fulfilment of the processing purposes set out above in Section 1, in particular to improve the quality and services of our Website and services as well as tailor marketing materials by analysing the usage behavior of our users in anonymised form, to prevent fraud, misuse of our IT systems, to ensure physical, IT and network security, to provide you with marketing materials if no consent is required.</li></ul><p>The provision of your personal data is not required by a statutory or contractual obligation. However, the provision of your personal data is necessary to enter into a contract with us or to receive our services, products and information as requested by you. The provision of your personal data is voluntary for you. </p><p>Not providing your personal data may result in disadvantages for you--for example, you may not be able to receive certain products and services. However, unless otherwise specified, not providing your personal data will not result in legal consequences for you.</p><h3>3. Who do we transfer your personal data to and where are they located?</h3><p>You should expect that we will transfer your personal data to third parties for the processing purposes described above as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Within the Amcor Group: Our affiliates (each affiliate including us referred to as "Amcor Affiliate") may receive your personal data as necessary for the processing purposes described above. Depending on the categories of personal data and the purposes for which the personal data has been collected, different internal departments within Amcor Affiliates receive your personal data. For example, our IT departments have access to your account data, and our sales departments have access to your data relating to an inquiry to respond to it. Moreover, other departments within the Amcor Group have access to certain personal data about you on a need to know basis, such as the legal department, the finance department or internal auditing.</p></li><li><p>With data processors: Certain third party service providers such as IT support providers, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, will receive your personal data to process such data under appropriate instructions ("Processors") as necessary for the processing purposes described above, such as Website service providers, customer care providers, marketing service providers, marketing platforms, IT support service providers, and other service providers who support us in maintaining our commercial relationship with you. The Processors will be subject to contractual obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal data, and to process the personal data only as instructed. A list with all currently engaged Processors can be requested from digital@amcor.com.</p></li><li><p>Other recipients: We may transfer - in compliance with applicable data protection law - personal data to law enforcement agencies, governmental authorities, judicial authorities, legal counsel, external consultants, or business partners. In case of a corporate merger or acquisition, personal data may be transferred to the third parties involved in the merger or acquisition. We will not disclose your personal data to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes or for any other purposes without permission.</p><p>Any access to your personal data is restricted to those individuals that have a need-to-know in order to fulfill their job responsibilities. Amcor will also disclose your personal data as required or permitted by applicable law to professional advisors, governmental authorities, and courts.</p><p>International transfers. You should expect that the recipients identified above which will receive or have access to your personal data, are located inside or outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). In particular, the parent Company of Amcor Group (Amcor Limited) is located in Australia.</p></li><li><p>For recipients located outside of the EEA, some are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and others are located in countries with adequacy decisions pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR (such as Switzerland), and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective. Certain Processors will either be certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or will be located in such a country with adequacy decision.</p></li><li><p>Other recipients might be located in countries which do not adduce an adequate level of protection from a European data protection law perspective. We will take all necessary measures to ensure that access to your personal data and transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. </p></li><li><p>With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR), approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(e) GDPR), or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient (Art. 46 (2)(f) GDPR). You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in Section 7 below.</p></li><li><p>The data transfer to Amcor Affiliates is protected by standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission (Art. 46(2)(c) or (d) GDPR).</p></li><li>The data transfer to Processors which are neither certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield nor in a country with other adequacy decision will typically also be protected by such standard data protection clauses.</li></ul><h3>4.	How long do we keep your personal data?</h3><p>Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to provide you with the services and products requested. Once you have terminated the contractual relationship with us or otherwise ended your relationship with us, we will remove your personal data from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymise it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which Amcor is subject, e.g. taxation purposes).</p><p>We may retain your personal data after the termination of the contractual relationship if your personal data are necessary to comply with other applicable laws or if we need your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, on a need to know basis only. To the extent possible, we will restrict the processing of your personal data for such limited purposes after the termination of the contractual relationship.</p><h3>5. What rights do you have and how can you assert your rights?</h3><ul><li><p>Right to withdraw your consent: If you have declared your consent regarding certain collecting, processing and other actions concerning your personal data (in particular regarding the receipt of direct marketing communication via email, SMS/MMS, fax, social media inmail, micro-messaging and telephone), you can withdraw this consent at any time with future effect. Such a withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of the processing prior to the consent withdrawal.
