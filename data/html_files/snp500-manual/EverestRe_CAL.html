<p>You have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete and if applicable, direct our service providers to delete, your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. In the event that you choose to exercise this right, please note that we (or our service provider) may nevertheless retain your personal information as permitted under applicable law, including, but not limited to for the following purposes: </p>

    <li> Comply with a legal obligation; or </li>
    <li> Make other internal and lawful uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Right to Correct </em></strong> </p>
<p>You have the right to request that we amend any inaccurate personal information that we have about you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to Restrict Processing </em></strong></p>
<p> You have the right to ask us to restrict processing your personal information in the following situations:</p>
<ol>
    <li>where you contest the accuracy of your personal information; </li>
    <li>where the processing is unlawful and you do not want us to delete your personal information;</li>
    <li>where we no longer need your personal information but you require the data in relation to a legal claim; or </li>
    <li>where you have objected to us processing your personal information pending verification as to whether or not our legitimate interests override your interests or in connection with legal proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you exercise this right we may only store your personal information and not further process the data unless you consent or the processing is necessary in relation to a legal claim or to protect the rights of another person or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to Object </em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></strong></p>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calling us at 844-949-2272; or</li>
    <li>Visiting<a href="https://www.everestre.com/About-Everest/Privacy-Security-and-Trust"> https://www.everestre.com/About-Everest/Privacy-Security-and-Trust </a>and submitting a verifiable request through our <a href="https://www.everestre.com/CCPA">Privacy Portal.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. Please note that if you authorize an agent to make a request on your behalf, the authorized agent will be required to provide proof of written authorization from you to make such a request as well as verify their own identity with Everest. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:</li>
    <li>Providing information such as policy number, claim number, broker name, broker agency name, date of loss, line of business, dates of employment in addition to basic information such full name, email address, phone number.</li>
    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format </em></strong></p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within thirty (30) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to [45/90] days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

<p>This site it not intended for children, and we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose information of children under the age of thirteen (13) without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. In an instance where such information was collected, it would be purely accidental and unintentional.</p>
<p><strong><span>Non-Discrimination</span></strong></p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights. Unless permitted by law, we will not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Deny you goods or services.</p>
    </li>
