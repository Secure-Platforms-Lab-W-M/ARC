Additionally, Union Pacific may use cookies, tracking pixels, and IP addresses to collect information regarding use of Union Pacific websites.</p> <p>We collect the following information about visitors:</p> <p><strong>Personal and company information, </strong>which you have voluntarily submitted to us (such as name, address, telephone number, email address, social security numbers, credit card numbers, or credit information) to register for secure applications such as MyUPRR, the Bidder's List registration, the up.jobs site, or through email or other communication with our offices. We may, from time to time, send information to registered users about system changes or new applications that we think may be of interest. Social Security Numbers submitted to us as part of an employment application are transmitted in an encrypted format. This information is not used outside of Union Pacific for any purpose other than that for which it was originally intended.</p> <p><strong>Aggregate information</strong>, or automatically collected non-identifying statistics (such as information about how many visitors log on to our sites, the pages they access, etc.).</p> <p>Our web servers collect the IP addresses of visitors, but not the email addresses.

					<h3>Cookies &amp; Tracking Pixels</h3>
				<p>A cookie is a very small text file that a Web page server sends to your hard drive, in response to your browser's request for a Web page. The purpose of the cookie is to help a website server recognize a user. Sites with secured information use cookies to help recognize User IDs, or on our site, to help users navigate between secured and unsecured information. Cookies also help website managers track which information on their site is most useful and most often accessed, and which pages are seldom visited. The cookie for our site, recognizable only to our server, simply helps to identify you and tell us which information you wish to read, and which you don't. To the extent permitted by your browser, you may opt out of cookie tracking.</p> <p>Union Pacific also collects information related to the effectiveness of our digital advertisements. Specifically, Union Pacific works with third-party companies that use tracking technologies (tracking pixels) on our website in order to serve interest-based ads on our behalf across the internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our sites and your interaction with our advertising and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and applications. For more information about this practice and to understand your options including how to opt out of receiving these tailored advertisements, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="">http://www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>

disclose what personal information Union Pacific collects, uses, and discloses about you (the “Right to Know”), you may have the right to ask us to delete the personal information we collect about you (“Right to Delete”), you may have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate personal information we have collected about you (“Right to Correct”), and you may request that we limit use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to that necessary for limited business purposes specified in the CCPA (“Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information”). These rights may be subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the CCPA. For example, we may deny a Right to Delete request when Union Pacific is required to retain your personal information to comply with our own legal obligations. When exercising your CCPA rights, Union Pacific will notify you of any exceptions or other reasons that require us to deny all or part of your request, unless prohibited from doing so by law.&nbsp;</p><p>Union Pacific does not sell your personal information. However, as a California resident you may still make an opt-out request that Union Pacific not sell or share your personal information with third parties using the process described below.&nbsp;</p><p>If your verifiable Request to Know includes a request to receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you in the last 12 months (or a specific subset of your information), we will seek to organize the personal information associated with you in file formats and categories that are easy to understand. We will contact you when the information is available to you.&nbsp;</p><h5>How to Submit a Privacy Request</h5><p>To exercise your individual rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you can email Union Pacific at <a target="" href="mailto:CCPA-Request@up.com">CCPA-Request@up.com</a>, call this toll-free number: 1-866-251-9185, or <a target="" href="/up/aboutup/corporate_info/privacy/inquiry/index.htm">complete this intake form</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Right to Know requests may be made up to two (2) times in a 12-month period. We will not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable CCPA request. However, we have the right to charge for or decline any unfounded, excessive, or repetitive requests, in such cases we will inform you of our decision and, if applicable, provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.&nbsp;</p><h5>Making a Request to Opt-Out of Sales or Sharing of Personal Information With Third Parties</h5><p>Although we do not currently sell, as that term has been defined by the CCPA, your personal information, if you would like to opt-out of any potential sale of your personal information, or would like to opt-out of sharing your with third parties (which does not include our permissible service providers or contractors),  you can do so by submitting a request at <a target="" href="mailto:CCPA-Request@up.com">CCPA-Request@up.com</a> or calling our toll-free number 1-866-251-9185.</p> <p>We do not target users younger than age 18 and, therefore, do not knowingly collect or sell personal information of minors younger than 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p> <h5>Verifying Requests&nbsp;</h5> <p>After submitting a request, we will take steps to verify your identity in order for us to properly respond and/or confirm that it is not a fraudulent request. In order to verify your identity, we will request, at a minimum, that you provide your name, email address, phone number, address, and relationship to UP, so that we can seek to match this information with the information existing in our systems. When providing us this information, you represent and affirm that all information provided is true and accurate. If we are unable to verify that the consumer submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected personal information, we may contact you for more information, or we may not be able to meet your request.</p><p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable CCPA request related to your personal information. If you are making a CCPA request as the authorized agent of a California consumer, we will ask you also submit reliable proof that you have been authorized in writing by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.</p><h5>Response Timing&nbsp;</h5> <p>When you make a request to exercise your CCPA rights, we will typically provide our response within 45 days. We will notify you within that time period and provide an explanation if we need additional time (up to 90 days) to process your request. When you opt-out from the sale or sharing of your personal information with third parties, we will honor your request as soon as feasible, but no later than 15 days from the date we receive your request.</p><h5>Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights&nbsp;</h5> <p>Union Pacific will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights, including in terms of the price or services that we offer.</p><h5>CCPA Questions</h5> <p>If you have any questions or concerns about Union Pacific’s CCPA Policy that are not requests, Union Pacific will attempt to answer any questions and you may contact us by email at <a target="" href="mailto:CCPA-Request@up.com">CCPA-Request@up.com</a>.</p>
