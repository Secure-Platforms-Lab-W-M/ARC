      <p>NAVEX has acquired WhistleB. WhistleB’s Privacy Policy is available here:&nbsp;<a href="https://whistleb.com/privacy-policy/">https://whistleb.com/privacy-policy/</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information or the “sharing” of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not sell your personal information in exchange for monetary consideration. We may disclose your personal information by allowing certain third parties (such as online advertising services) to collect your personal information via cookies and other automated tracking technologies on our Websites for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Under California law, these kinds of disclosures may be considered a “sale” or “sharing”. For more information about our privacy practices, please read the below for our full Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>To submit an opt-out of sale or sharing request with respect to this device and browser, turn off Advertising Cookies from our Cookie Preferences tool <a href="https://www.navex.com/en-us/cookie-preferences/">here</a>. Make sure you click on the “Submit Preferences” button at the bottom to save your opt-out choice.</p>
<p>You will need to renew this choice each time you clear your cookies or use a new browser or device.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>NAVEX and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“NAVEX,” “we,” “us,” etc.) offer guidance, software and technology products for companies to manage risk and reach their compliance goals. We provide risk and compliance solutions including, without limitation: compliance training, policy and procedure management, ethics and incident management (including a hotline), vendor risk management, risk management software, claims management, and compliance analytics. We also offer various resources and ways for compliance professionals to connect through our websites.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to improving workplace integrity worldwide.  We help our business customers create a more resilient business by providing tools to identify and reduce risk and misconduct. When it comes to handling your personal information, then, it is not enough for us to simply abide by the law. We believe it is important to set an example for other companies to follow, which includes transparency about personal information. This Privacy Statement is part of our effort to achieve that.</p>
<p>We want you to be confident that we are handling your personal information with care and respect, whether you’re completing job training, delivering or receiving corporate policies that shape how your job gets done, or filing a complaint, concern or question. We also want to explain the tools and options available to you to manage and protect that information within the bounds of law, your rights, and your company’s risk and compliance goals.</p>
<p>We will collect personal information in different ways and for different purposes as we run our business and deliver services to our business customers. <strong>We have created separate Privacy Statements, one for our corporate business operations and one for our service Applications, intended to provide you with information about what personal information we collect, how and why, how we use it, who we share it with, how we protect it and how long we keep it.</strong></p>

<h2><a href="/privacy-statement#applications-privacy-statement"></a>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p><strong>Updated: December 2022</strong></p>
<p>NAVEX and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“NAVEX,” “we,” “us,” etc.) offer guidance, software and technology for companies to manage risk and reach their compliance goals.  We are dedicated to improving workplace integrity worldwide and helping companies create a more resilient business by providing tools to identify and reduce risk and misconduct.</p>
<p>This Statement applies to personal information NAVEX collects, uses and discloses as a “controller” in connection with operating our business and in connection with the representatives of NAVEX’s business customers and business partners,  including (1) on our Websites (<a href="https://www.navex.com/">https://www.navex.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.netclaim.com/">https://www.netclaim.com/</a>, and all subdomains hosted by NAVEX) and any sites or products that display these terms (collectively “Website”); (2) through webinars or online events we may host or sponsor; and (3) at in-person events, such as trade shows or conferences, and other outreach and marketing activities and communications.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to any website, mobile app, service, or product that does not display or link to this Privacy Statement or that contains its own privacy notice.</p>
<p>Our Applications Privacy Statement covers our privacy practices in connection with the use of our the software applications and related services that we provide to our business customers.</p>
<h3>How we collect personal information</h3>
<p>We may collect personal information from you directly or indirectly.&nbsp; For example, when you register for one of our web seminars or virtual events or sign up to receive our email communications, you provide personal information directly to us.&nbsp; Other times, personal information is collected automatically as you use our Website.&nbsp; In addition, we also may receive personal information from third parties with whom we work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect personal information when you provide it</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may provide certain kinds of personal information directly by interacting with NAVEX online and offline (via social media or Web forms, by phone, email, in person – or even through regular old postal mail).&nbsp; Personal information may also be provided to us directly or indirectly through the use of our customer relationship management systems, in order for us to track support for the service in our role as a controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you register for a web seminar or download white papers available on our Website, for example, you typically provide your email address, phone number and geographic location.&nbsp; Or, to become a member of <a href="https://www.navexglobal.com/compliancenext/">Compliance Next</a>, you may provide your name and email address and then create a username and password, information that on subsequent visits helps us confirm your identity and grant you access to member-exclusive content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also collect personal information, including your name and contact information that&nbsp; you voluntarily provide at industry events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect personal information from third-party sources</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may collect personal information about you from third parties, including from conference partners, public databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, including advertising companies that specialize in interest-based ads.&nbsp; We may combine this with information we already have about you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This helps us update, expand, and analyze our records, identify new customers, and provide information tailored to products and services that may interest you.&nbsp; You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising by clicking <a href="https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> (or if you are in the European Union, click <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>.) Opting out of interest-based advertising will not prevent ads from being served to you; the ads will simply be more general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also work with third parties to support delivery of our online services (such as email and content streaming), or those that help us manage events.&nbsp; Your personal information may be provided to us by those third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may collect personal information from online social networks if you take part in a forum, for example, on LinkedIn.&nbsp; We may collect personal information when you click “Share This” or “Like” buttons or otherwise use social media buttons or plug-ins.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect personal information using automated technologies</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes personal information is collected by automated technologies and shared with us when Website visitors navigate through our products and services online.&nbsp; We may track your browsing actions and log your IP address.&nbsp; We track product preferences and content downloads, to make future visits to our Website more efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other automated collection technologies – such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts – are used by us to analyze trends, administer the Website, and track users’ movements around the Website.&nbsp; We, and our third-party partners, may also use these technologies to gather demographic information about our user base as individuals and in the aggregate.&nbsp; You may opt out of us sharing your information with our advertising partners by not accepting our cookies on your internet browser.&nbsp; Keep in mind that declining certain cookies may decrease the functionality of the Website or disable some features.&nbsp; Read more about our use of cookies associated with the applicable components of our Websites (<a href="https://www.navex.com/">https://www.navex.com/</a>, <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://www.netclaim.com/</a>, and all subdomains hosted by NAVEX) <a href="https://www.navex.com/en-us/cookie-statement/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We will not knowingly collect information from anyone younger than 16 years</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Website and services associated with our Website are not intended for use by anyone younger than 16 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone younger than that.&nbsp; If we become aware that personal information of anyone younger than 16 has been provided to us, for any purpose, we will delete the information from our files.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our legal basis for collection</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain data protection laws require that we have a legal basis for collecting your personal information.&nbsp; The legal basis we rely upon may be different in each circumstance or we may have one or more legal basis for the collection.&nbsp; When accessing our Website, for example, we collect personal information from you where 1) we have your consent, 2) where your personal information is necessary for us to provide a service (for example, when you register for a webinar), or 3) where we have a legitimate interest to process your information and that legitimate interest is not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal information, or to process your personal information to exercise, establish or defend legal claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do-not-track requests</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” privacy preference.&nbsp; Generally, when a user turns on the Do Not Track Signal, their browser sends a message to websites requesting that the user not be tracked.&nbsp; Our Website currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.&nbsp; For California residents, please refer to the <a href="/en-us/california-consumer-privacy-statement/">California Consumer Privacy Statement</a> for information on using the Global Privacy Control signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we use personal information</h3>
<p>As users navigate through the Website, their movements may be tracked and analyzed.&nbsp; We use the personal information we obtain:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide our products and services, including our Website.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To market our products and services, including through email and phone.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To respond to support requests.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To personalize your experience with the Website.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide access to and maintain the security and integrity of the Website and services, which include personal information associated with logs generated from our service Applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To provide updates regarding the Website and marketing information, such as special promotions or surveys, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To perform analytics (including market and consumer research, trend analysis, financial analysis, and anonymization of personal information).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Operate, evaluate, develop, manage and improve our business (including operating, administering, analyzing and improving our products and services; developing new products and services; managing and evaluating the effectiveness of our communications; performing accounting, auditing, billing reconciliation and collection activities and other internal functions).&nbsp;</li>
<li>To manage professional relationships with our business customers and partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and internal policies for maintaining records.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To protect all parties in the event of disputes.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To comply with court orders and legal processes, and to enforce our <a href="/en-us/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For any other legal, business, or marketing purposes that comply with the practices described in this Statement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted above, this Privacy Statement applies to the personal information we process as a controller.&nbsp; In contrast, when processing information in connection with the delivery of our Applications, including providing guidance and services to our business customers, we act as a processor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The information we receive through our Applications and related services is subject to our <a href="#applications-privacy-statement">Applications Privacy Statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When we share personal information</h3>
<p>We may share your personal information amongst our affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; We also may share your personal information with third-party service providers that provide services on our behalf, such as email delivery, data hosting, analytics, payment processing and content streaming.&nbsp; We do not authorize such service providers to retain, use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform the services they provide to us or comply with legal requirements.&nbsp; In addition, we may share your personal information with other third parties, such as our advertising partners that help us with our marketing efforts, including sending and analyzing our marketing efforts by measuring whether recipients have opened an email and clicked on any content within it.&nbsp; Our service providers and advertising partners may collect browsing data that includes IP addresses, referring pages, and users’ movements as they navigate the Website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may disclose personal information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (4) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (5) when we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, or to protect our property or other rights or those of other individuals, third parties, or the public at large; or (6) otherwise with your consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have about you in the event of a potential or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution or liquidation).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we secure personal information</h3>
<p>We have implemented and maintain administrative, physical, and technology-based security measures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, destruction and alteration of personal information.</p>
<h3>Data retention</h3>
<p>Where NAVEX collects your personal information for its own independent business purpose, such as through our Websites, or in connection with webinars and events, we will retain your information in accordance with our data retention practices and in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent required by applicable law, we will retain your personal information for the time necessary to serve the purpose for which it was originally collected or you subsequently authorized.&nbsp; For example, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as necessary to comply with our legal obligations and rights, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Data storage and international transfers</h3>
<p>NAVEX is headquartered in the United States.&nbsp; Your personal information may be transferred to, processed, and maintained in places other than where you live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States currently is not a country the European Union (“EU”) has deemed “adequate” under applicable data protection laws.&nbsp; NAVEX collects, transfers, and processes personal information under terms required by applicable law, including:&nbsp; when you provide your consent, to perform a contract with you (such as to deliver products or services), or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of NAVEX in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms.&nbsp; NAVEX may enter into data protection agreements or other legally approved mechanisms with its vendors to support compliance with applicable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAVEX (and its subsidiaries The Network, Inc. and Lockpath, Inc.) are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (the “Frameworks”).&nbsp; However, in 2020, both Frameworks were declared invalid as a legal mechanism we could rely on for the lawful transfer and processing of personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.&nbsp; Despite this, NAVEX continues to certify its compliance with the Frameworks as a means of evidencing its continued commitment to protecting personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and remains under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp; As required by the Frameworks, any personal information we receive under the Frameworks will be maintained in accordance with the Privacy Shield principles.&nbsp; NAVEX is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.&nbsp; NAVEX complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.&nbsp; In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that the personal information we process will remain protected in accordance with this Statement when transferred internationally, including when processed internationally by third-party service providers and partners.&nbsp; For personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, data protection laws in those jurisdictions require that that we tell you the legal safeguards we have in place to protect that personal information.&nbsp; We may implement the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, rely on a third-party service provider’s Binding Corporate Rules or other legally approved mechanism, for any transfer of personal information to non-European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland third-party service providers or business partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal information received by NAVEX following invalidation of the Frameworks will be transferred and processed in accordance with the applicable European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp; More information about Privacy Shield can be found <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">here</a> and more information about the Standard Contractual Clauses can be found <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.&nbsp; Under certain conditions, more fully described on the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">Privacy Shield website</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Applications Privacy Statement</h2>
<p><strong>Updated: December 2022</strong></p>
<p>NAVEX and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“NAVEX,” “we,” “us,” etc.) offer guidance, software and technology for companies seeking to manage risk and reach their compliance goals.&nbsp; We are dedicated to improving workplace integrity worldwide and helping companies create a more resilient business by providing tools to identify and reduce risk and misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Statement applies to our software related services and solutions, (the “Application” or “Applications”) and any sites or products that display these terms.&nbsp; It does not apply to any website, mobile app, service, or product that does not display or link to this Privacy Statement or that contains its own Privacy Statement.&nbsp; For information about how we use personal information we receive in connection with operating our business, including our websites, please see our <a href="https://www.navex.com/en-us/privacy-statement/?nstoken=7SOY%2FFbMog3%2FTQb%2FYPVG%2B8gWdcjm4BV%2FOUuxmqDD%2B7cHkThOMV%2F%2Bf9OfldJ1%2F3qCrWmy69jwbqJasNQ5OxjVwviHZdAMszK1Ot5TLKyYSxoN3o%2B2OOiyY0joZU0vWQvrWLS4z0wHuVwCVBTu5mcRVn1XSsVWAreyB3hevn3m44pP75Fyd5lMk9Eqjt4vG8PNh0swligRIxDhvA4B7Alyf7yuEKU8%2FDdtd1kLsA4QSiDrBG6QkBEMnKKesl7im2dwTbOwRVsHcWh27BKNnJOtZKfnxOAeOaHuRI60z%2FMXZnPpXbLnrrEBYrMrb0NitdyE5D6lzNVckRO8a9vCiLxccS9dq9F%2BvYX9qlIPLeT11HozF42w%2BnCQUzq0zabGevOUmfqUGpBHCkuxQzbrq6ptFQQimA%3D%3D&amp;nscheck=%2BiiiprMfI%2FQEXD4B6XZ29g%3D%3D#Web">Privacy Statement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the services we provide to our business customers, you may interact with us online (through the Applications) or by phone and in doing so, you may share your personal information with us.&nbsp; The information received by NAVEX in delivering the Applications is done on behalf of our business customers and is processed by us according to the contract with that business customer.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we collect personal information</h3>
<p>We may collect personal information from you directly or indirectly.&nbsp; For example, when your employer or other related company purchases one of our technology solutions to manage risk or operate within applicable legal and ethical standards, you may provide personal information directly to us through your participation in job training, reviewing policies and procedures or reporting a concern.&nbsp; Other times, personal information may be collected automatically as you use our Application as we outline in this Statement.&nbsp; In addition, we also may receive personal information from our business customers or other related third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect information through the Application on behalf of business customers who use our software solutions including, without limitation:&nbsp; compliance training, policy and procedure management, ethics and incident management (including a hotline), vendor risk management, risk management software, claims management, and compliance analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our business customers determine why (the purpose) and what (the nature) personal information is collected, used, stored, or deleted within the Applications purchased.&nbsp; NAVEX acts as a service provider, or data processor, of this information under the terms of our contract with that customer, the data controller.&nbsp; Questions about how business customers use, share, or process that information should be sent to them directly.&nbsp; Unless prohibited by law, NAVEX will honor and support our business customer’s instructions with respect to your personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legal basis for collection</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we collect personal information through our Applications, we do so as a processor, or service provider, as instructed by our business customer, the controller.&nbsp; Certain data protection laws require that controllers have a lawful or legal basis for collecting personal information.&nbsp; The lawfulness of our collection of personal information is determined by the controller, our business customer.&nbsp; If you have questions about the legal basis or lawfulness of our collection of personal information, please contact that business customer directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect personal information when you provide it</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may provide certain kinds of personal information directly by interacting with the Applications (whether you’re an employer or employee or other stakeholder) or offline (by phone, email, or in person–for example through discussions with your manager–or through postal mail).&nbsp; Depending on the software service, users may provide different types of personal information, as outlined in the table below.&nbsp; The type of personal information we collect is determined by our business customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>We collect personal information using automated technologies</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal information may be collected by automated technologies – such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts – within the Application being used.&nbsp; In most cases these Application cookies are required but, in some cases, they are optional and only set where you request that we store information.&nbsp; More information about our use of cookies associated with the Application is available <a href="https://www.navex.com/cookie-statement">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other personal information, such as IP addresses, may be automatically collected from users of the Applications.&nbsp; Doing so helps us protect and secure the integrity of our systems and the data we host.&nbsp; They may be shared with law enforcement to enforce our rights, ensure the security and integrity of our systems, or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We collect personal information from third-party sources</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we provide our business customers with tools to improve their risk and compliance practices, this may require them to share personal information about their employees and other stakeholders with us.&nbsp; The kinds of personal information typically collected are names, business contact details (such as email addresses), and job titles.&nbsp; When your employer or business partner gives us your information, we use it only for the specific purpose for which it was provided.&nbsp; Collecting this personal information helps us deliver our services and comply with customer contracts.&nbsp; Please see the table above for more information on what personal information we collect and the purpose for why we collect it.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How we use personal information</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, NAVEX’s business customers determine what personal information is collected by us and how it is used.&nbsp; We use the personal information collected, as a processor, in accordance with our business customer’s instructions.&nbsp; We may use it in these ways:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide the Applications for both customers and their end users.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To maintain the security and integrity of the Applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To communicate with customers and their end users about the Applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To respond to support requests.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To develop and improve the Applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business and internal policies for maintaining records.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To protect all parties in the event of disputes.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To comply with court orders and legal processes, and to enforce our <a href="/en-us/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> and this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For any other legal or business purposes that comply with the practices described in this Statement.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>When we share personal information</h3>
<p>Once your personal information is collected in the Application, as detailed above, we may share it with third parties, including your employer or business partners for various reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with third parties to help deliver our services to customers.&nbsp; We do not authorize such third parties to retain, use or disclose the information, except as necessary to provide and deliver those services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted previously, we may share your personal information with the relevant business customer in accordance with our contract with that customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may disclose personal information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (4) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (5) when we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, or to protect our property or other rights or those of other individuals, third parties, or the public at large; or (6) otherwise with your consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have about you in the event of a potential or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution or liquidation).&nbsp;</p>

<p>How We Secure Personal Information&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have implemented and maintain administrative, physical, and technology-based security measures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, destruction and alteration of personal information in our systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Data retention&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Personal information collected by NAVEX through our Applications will be retained as directed by our business customer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you have any questions about how long personal information is retained, please contact the applicable business customer directly.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Data storage and international transfers&nbsp;</h3>
<p>NAVEX is headquartered in the United States.&nbsp; Your personal information may be transferred to, processed, and maintained in places other than where you live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States currently is not a country the European Union (“EU”) has deemed “adequate” under applicable data protection laws.&nbsp; NAVEX collects, transfers, and processes personal information in accordance with its legal obligations under contracts with its business customers who, as we have noted previously in this Privacy Statement, determine the legal basis for our collection and processing of personal information, in particular from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.&nbsp; If you want to know what legal basis is relied upon for NAVEX to receive and processes personal information, you will need to contact the relevant business customer directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAVEX (and its subsidiaries The Network, Inc. and Lockpath, Inc.) are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (the “Frameworks”).&nbsp; However, in 2020, both Frameworks were declared invalid as a legal mechanism that could be relied on for the lawful transfer and processing of personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland.&nbsp; Despite this, NAVEX continues to certify its compliance with the Frameworks as a means of evidencing its continued commitment to protecting personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland and remains under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp; As required by the Frameworks, any personal information we receive under the Frameworks will be maintained in accordance with the Privacy Shield principles.&nbsp; NAVEX is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.&nbsp; NAVEX complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.&nbsp; In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that the personal information we process will remain protected in accordance with this Statement when transferred internationally, including when processed internationally by third-party service providers and partners assisting us in delivery of the Applications.&nbsp; For personal information from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, NAVEX relies on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, a third-party service provider’s Binding Corporate Rules or other legally approved mechanism, for any transfer of personal information to non-European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland third-party service providers or business partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal information received by NAVEX following invalidation of the Frameworks will be transferred and processed by NAVEX in accordance with the applicable European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp; More information about Privacy Shield can be found <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">here</a> and more information about the Standard Contractual Clauses can be found <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.&nbsp; Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we receive personal information through our Applications as processors for our business customers, who determine the lawfulness of our collection and the purpose for the processing.&nbsp; The data in our Applications is managed by the business customer according to their own internal policies and procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, anyone seeking to exercise data protection rights granted by applicable law should direct their request to the relevant company or organization (typically their employer).&nbsp; Inquiries made to NAVEX requesting access, alteration, or deletion of personal information will be forwarded to our business customer for resolution.&nbsp; NAVEX is not permitted to independently alter that information but will support a business customer’s request to do so, unless otherwise required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For data subjects from the European Union, United Kingdom and Switzerland</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain data protection laws of the European Union (General Data Protection Act), United Kingdom (Data Protection Act 2018) and Switzerland (Swiss Federal Data Protection Act) provide that controllers of personal data honor certain rights granted to data subjects who reside in the applicable country.&nbsp; As noted previously, NAVEX is a data processor to its business customers who are data controllers under these laws.&nbsp; NAVEX is fully committed to supporting its business customers in their compliance with applicable law.&nbsp; If you are a data subject from the European Union, United Kingdom or Switzerland, and wish to exercise your rights in relation to personal data NAVEX may have collected on behalf of its business customer, please contact that business customer directly to exercise your rights.&nbsp; If we receive a request from a data subject for one of our business customers, we will direct the request to the customer for review and response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have questions or complaints about the way we handle personal information, please contact us via the below contact details.&nbsp; We will promptly manage any complaints received from an individual.&nbsp; Alternatively, and at your choice, if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.&nbsp;</p>
