It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites.

You may also update information relevant to your use of our mobile application(s) through the app itself. You also have the right to request that we delete your information. We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or deference of legal claims.</p><p><strong>Right to restrict the processing of your personal information:</strong> You have the right to restrict the use of your personal information when (i) you contest the accuracy of the data; (ii) the use is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer need the personal information for the relevant purposes, but we require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our personal information use justified on our legitimate interests verification as to whether we have a compelling interest to continue to use your data.

When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites. Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third-party seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third-party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions and any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third-party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third-party to make changes as we will conclude that third-party has an appropriate legal basis to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third-party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p><h2>Your role in protecting your information</h2><p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="/web/en-us/content/help/PIN-password.aspx?POS=US&amp;POS=US">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Changing your marketing preferences</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails, phone calls or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p><h2>Location of your information/data transfer/notice to non-US persons</h2><p>United will transfer, store, and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. Where personal information that we collect is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described in this policy, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes. You may have a right to details of the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA. By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you acknowledge such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p><p>At this time, our precise geo-location tracking and related offers and services as discussed in this Policy only are available at certain airports in the U.S. Non-U.S. persons who choose to use this service may have certain rights to their personal data as discussed <a href="/ual/en/us/fly/privacy-eu-full.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Other sites/digital channels</h2><p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third-party sites.

You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Changing your marketing preferences</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails, phone calls or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p><h2>Location of your information/data transfer/notice to non-US persons</h2><p>United will transfer, store and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p><p>At this time, our precise geo-location tracking and related offers and services as discussed in this Policy only are available at certain airports in the U.S. Non-U.S. persons who choose to use this service may have certain rights to their personal data as discussed <a href="/ual/en/us/fly/privacy-eu-full.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Other sites/digital channels</h2><p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third-party sites. Any access to and use of such linked sites is not governed by this Privacy Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party sites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party sites.</p><h2>Contact us</h2><p>If you have comments or questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@united.com">privacy@united.com</a>.</p><p>If you have comments or questions about the privacy practices of MIPA, please contact MileagePlusPrivacy@united.com. Where your personal information is held by MIPA you may have various rights under the DPL, and may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the Cayman Islands Ombudsman.</p><h2>Legal effect and changes to the policy</h2><p>As previously stated, this Privacy Policy is not a contract nor does it otherwise create any legal rights or obligations in addition to those provided under applicable data protection laws. Rather, this Privacy Policy merely reflects guidelines setting forth Unitedâs intended business practices. By using any United digital channel, and/or by providing any information to United online or offline, you acknowledge the collection and use of such information by United, its affiliates, partners, contractors and permitted agents as herein described and consistent with applicable laws.

In your message, please indicate the ARCO right you would like to exercise. We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes. We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p><h2>Protecting information collected</h2><p>United maintains physical, administrative, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites. Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third party seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions and any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude that third party has an appropriate legal basis to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p><h2>Your role in protecting your information</h2><p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="/web/en-us/content/help/PIN-password.aspx?POS=US&amp;POS=US">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Changing your marketing preferences</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails, phone calls or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p><h2>Location of your information/data transfer/notice to non-US persons</h2><p>United will transfer, store and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p><p>At this time, our precise geo-location tracking and related offers and services as discussed in this Policy only are available at certain airports in the U.S. Non-U.S. persons who choose to use this service may have certain rights to their personal data as discussed <a href="/ual/en/us/fly/privacy-eu-full.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Other sites/digital channels</h2><p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third-party sites.

When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites.

Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third-party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Opting out</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change.

Rather, this Privacy Policy merely reflects guidelines setting forth Unitedâs intended business practices. By using any United digital channel, and/or by providing any information to United online or offline, you acknowledge the collection and use of such information by United, its affiliates, partners, contractors and permitted agents as herein described and consistent with applicable laws.

In your message, please indicate the ARCO right you would like to exercise. We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes. We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p><h2>Protecting information collected</h2><p>United maintains physical, administrative, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites. Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third party seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions and any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude that third party has an appropriate legal basis to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p><h2>Your role in protecting your information</h2><p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="/web/en-us/content/help/PIN-password.aspx?POS=US&amp;POS=US">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Changing your marketing preferences</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails, phone calls or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p><h2>Location of your information/data transfer/notice to non-US persons</h2><p>United will transfer, store and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p><p>At this time, our precise geo-location tracking and related offers and services as discussed in this Policy only are available at certain airports in the U.S. Non-U.S. persons who choose to use this service may have certain rights to their personal data as discussed <a href="/ual/en/us/fly/privacy-eu-full.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Other sites/digital channels</h2><p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third-party sites.

Please reference this Privacy Policy in those communications.</p><h2>Legal effect and changes to the policy</h2><p>As previously stated, this Privacy Policy is not a contract nor does it otherwise create any legal rights or obligations in addition to those provided under applicable data protection laws.

Consistent with applicable law, United may also share your information with third parties for marketing purposes including but not limited to the third partyâs own marketing or promotional purposes or other companiesâ marketing purposes in order for them to present you with offers on services or products that may be of interest to you. We may share your information with contracted corporate customers as part of our management of agreements we have with them.</li><li><strong>Marketing partners.</strong> If we jointly offer a product or service with a different entity, we will share your information with that entity to assist in marketing and providing that product or service. These entities may include, but are not limited to: airlines, car rental agencies, hotels and travel agencies. Consistent with applicable law, we may also share your information with our partners for their own marketing purposes.</li><li><strong>Research and analytics.</strong> We may use and disclose your information for research and analytics purposes.</li><li><strong>Aggregate information.</strong> Aggregate, anonymized information, such as demographic information, domain names, other site traffic information, etc., may at times be shared with United partners or other third parties. Examples of aggregate information are X% of eligible tickets purchased are eTickets; X% of subscribers use a mobile application, etc.</li><li><strong>Law enforcement/Legal processes/other uses.</strong> United may also disclose your information: if required to do so by law, court order, subpoena or other legal process; as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority; to protect the rights or property of United, its customers, its sites or site users; or when we believe in good faith that it is in the interests of aviation security or that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In certain circumstances, Unitedâs third party service providers may be required to disclose information to government or law enforcement authorities. Security, health and customs and immigration laws in the U.S. and many other countries require all airlines, including United, to provide border control agencies or other governmental authorities with passenger data. In order to comply with these laws we may disclose information about you and your travel arrangements to such authorities.</li><li><strong>Business transactions.</strong> If United is or may be acquired by or merges with another entity, if any of our assets are transferred to another entity, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information that we collected from and about you to the other entity.</li><li><strong>Additional notice for users of certain mobile websites.</strong> You may make purchases using MileagePlus award miles through certain mobile websites. If you choose to use these sites, then United will receive information from the third party about your purchase and will exchange information with the third party to facilitate the transaction and the use of miles from your account.</li></ul><h2>Use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies</h2><p>United and our third party service providers collect information by using technologies and methodologies, such as "cookies", tags, web beacons or other similar technologies that enable tracking as you browse our sites. We use these technologies to authenticate you as a user, to remember your preferences for using the site, to present offers that may be of interest and to facilitate transactions, such as flight searches and purchases. We and our third party service providers also use these tools to analyze use of our sites and our services. We may use this information in the aggregate or combine it with information that we have already collected about you.</p><p><strong>Cookie.</strong> "Cookies" are small bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Web beacons or âpixel tagsâ are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring information. Cookies and the other technologies discussed in this section allow us to recognize your preference information, to track your transactions and to facilitate effective website administration.</p><p>Cookies help establish a user session and allow our server to provide site users with the appropriate information, advertisements and services. We also use cookies to ensure you obtain the information you request, to authenticate your authority to access the site and to track the usage of our websites in order to improve the site(s) according to our customersâ needs. If you are a registered user on our site and you elect to have the site store your MileagePlus number, the cookie stored on your computer will contain your MileagePlus number.</p><p>If you do not want your information to be collected through cookies, you can change the preferences in your particular Internet browser. Some website functionality may not work properly if your browser does not accept cookies. Specifically, if you choose not to accept our cookies and are a registered user, you will not have access to your information, such as your user profile, itineraries, award travel, upgrades and MileagePlus summary information, on this site.

These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your transactions and facilitate effective website administration. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computerâs hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We and our third-party service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our sites and services to, among other things, track the activities of visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails sent to you to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p><h2>Targeted advertising</h2><p>We and our third-party service providers, including ad networks, use the information that we collect about you to serve advertisements to you on various channels, including, but not limited to, United and third-party websites, United and third party mobile apps and other mediums that may include social networks and television. We and our third-party service providers may collect the data that we use to determine relevant advertising from the following sources: data collected about you online and through your use of our mobile apps, whether collected directly or automatically through cookies, web beacons and other technologies, including technologies designed to collect data through mobile apps, third party sites (e.g., engagement with social media when publicly available), and offline, including, but not limited to, data combined or appended from various sources. These advertisements may be about United products and services or products and services of third parties that we think might be of interest to you. United and our third party service providers may use cookies and web beacons when working with these companies to provide them information regarding your use of the site (whether individually or in the aggregate) to assist them in determining relevant advertising.</p><p>In addition, some third party advertising technology used by United to deliver advertisements may use separate cookies and other tracking technologies. This technology may be delivered via visits to our website, email messages, apps or otherwise. Web beacons on some pages of our site, in conjunction with these advertising cookies and our other cookies, enable the third-party advertising technology to better understand onsite activity in the aggregate, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this website, other websites or apps, and to learn which advertisements bring users to our site or our apps or otherwise take action.</p><p>Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Third party ad networks may be members of either the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ) or About Ads-Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAIâ). If they are members and you do not want to receive targeted advertisements from these third-party ad networks, you may opt out.

It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other non-United websites. If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit one of the above referenced opt-out pages and then you erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAI opt-out may no longer be active.</p><h2>Third-party analytics</h2><p>We also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate the use of our websites and apps and the services we provide. We use these tools to gather information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our websites with other information that they have collected. This Policy does not cover such third partiesâ use of the data.</p><h2>Your legal rights</h2><p>Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information:</p><p><strong><u>Right to access, correct, and delete your personal information:</u></strong> Please ensure that you tell us about changes in personal information (e.g., change of address, redress number) so that ensure that your information is up to date.

If you are a MileagePlus member, you can create, view or update your MileagePlus account by accessing it through the MileagePlus profile section on united.com or by calling +1-800-421-4655. You may also update information relevant to your use of our mobile application(s) through the app itself. You also have the right to request that we delete your information. We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or deference of legal claims.</p><p><strong><u>Right to restrict the processing of your personal information:</u></strong> You have the right to restrict the use of your personal information when (i) you contest the accuracy of the data; (ii) the use is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer need the personal information for the relevant purposes, but we require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our personal information use justified on our legitimate interests verification as to whether we have a compelling interest to continue to use your data. We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where: we have your consent; or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</p><p><strong><u>Right to data portability:</u></strong> To the extent that we process your information (i) based on your consent or under a contract; and (ii) through automated means, you have the right to receive such personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller.</p><p><strong><u>Right to object to the processing of your personal information:</u></strong> You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.</p><p><strong><u>Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority:</u></strong> You have a right to lodge a complaint with the National Authority for Data Protection (ANPD) if you have concerns about how we are processing your personal information. We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.</p><p><strong>Right to obtain information about the entities with which we share your personal information:</strong> You have the right to obtain accurate information on the public and private entities with which we share your personal information.</p><p><strong>Right to delete your personal information processed based on consent and to receive information on the possibility of not providing consent:</strong> You have the right to request that personal information which processing is based solely on previously given consent be deleted, as well as the right to receive clear information on the possibility of not providing consent and the relevant consequences of this, such as the impossibility of using part of the available services.</p><p><strong><u>How to exercise your rights:</u></strong> If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please send us a request via <a href="mailto:privacy@united.com">privacy@united.com</a>. In your message, please indicate the right you would like to exercise. We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the personal information requested to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p><h2>Protecting information collected</h2><p>United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites. Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. Unless and until we are advised otherwise, we consider that such third party has an appropriate legal basis to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude that third party has an appropriate legal basis to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p><h2>Your role in protecting your information</h2><p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="/web/en-us/content/help/PIN-password.aspx?POS=US&amp;POS=US">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p><h2>Opting out</h2><p>MileagePlus members can opt out of receiving marketing or promotion-related emails or direct mail from United by accessing their account profile information on the United website and changing their profile to indicate their desire to be excluded. In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future. Regardless of your opt-out preferences, we reserve the right to send you emails or other communications for administrative purposes.</p><h2>Location of your information/Data transfer/Notice to non-US persons</h2><p>United will transfer, store, and process information that we collect about you, as described in this Policy, in the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. By submitting any personal information or by using the website and without limitation to any other rights or obligations we have, you acknowledge such transfer to, and processing in, the United States and these other countries, and acknowledge that your information may be subject to access by law enforcement and other government entities, including courts and tribunals, in accordance with laws applicable in those jurisdictions.</p><h2>Other sites/digital channels</h2><p>Our sites and our online services may contain links to third party sites. Any access to and use of such linked sites is not governed by this Policy but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party sites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party sites.</p><h2>Contact us</h2><p>If you have comments or questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@united.com">privacy@united.com</a>.</p><p>If you have comments or questions about the privacy practices of MIPA, please contact MileagePlusPrivacy@united.com. Where your personal information is held by MIPA you may have various rights under the DPL, and may also have a right to lodge a complaint with the Cayman Islands Ombudsman.</p><h2>Legal effect and changes to the policy</h2><p>As previously stated, this Privacy Policy is not a contract nor does it otherwise create any legal rights or obligations in addition to those provided under applicable data protection laws. Rather, this Privacy Policy merely reflects guidelines setting forth Unitedâs intended business practices. By using any United digital channel, and/or by providing any information to United online or offline, you acknowledge the collection and use of such information by United, its affiliates, partners, contractors and permitted agents as herein described and consistent with applicable laws. Also, United, in its discretion, may amend, interpret, modify or withdraw any portion of this Privacy Policy and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site, and your continued use of our digital channels or offline outlets constitutes your acknowledgement of those changes. A version of this Privacy Policy has been effective since October 15, 2002, and was last updated on March 12, 2021. This Privacy Policy supersedes previous privacy policies posted on united.com and coair.com.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2><span>Information we collect directly from you</span></h2>

<p>Examples of the types of information we collect directly from you are described below.</p><h3>MileagePlus information</h3><p>When you enroll in MileagePlus, or if you are already a MileagePlus member, we collect specific information such as your name, address, phone number(s), email address, MileagePlus account number, and password or other account security authentication information. If you create a traveler profile, we also will collect the information that you choose to provide to us, which may include, but is not limited to: payment information (e.g., credit card information, billing name/address), telephone numbers, email addresses, general requests or special needs, travel preferences and loyalty program information.</p><p>In certain situations, we collect information that is defined as âsensitiveâ under applicable data protection laws. We provide you the option to make a special meal request (on certain flights) and/or provide information about special travel needs. If you choose to make such request and/or provide such information, we collect information in order to provide accommodations during travel. In addition, MileagePlus members can choose to save their special meal requests and/or special needs in their profile information for use in connection with bookings made through united.com. These saved preferences and/or selections can be changed at any time.</p><p>Personal information collected and processed as part of our MileagePlus program is held by Mileage Plus Intellectual Property Assets, Ltd. (âMIPAâ), a member of the United group of companies, whose registered office is at Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. MIPA will be a data controller in respect of that personal information under the Data Protection Law, 2017 of the Cayman Islands (âDPLâ).</p><p>Where MIPA is the data controller, it processes MileagePlus personal information where it has an appropriate legal basis. This may be because:</p><ul><li>Our use of your personal information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organization (for example in order to make improvements to the MileagePlus program and services and to provide you with information you request);</li><li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (for example where we use your name and contact information to fulfill your MileagePlus benefits); and/or</li><li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to undertake vetting to comply with safety and security regulations or where we are required to disclose personal information to a court or tax authority). If you would like to find out more about the legal bases on which we process personal information, please contact us using the details below.</li></ul><h3>Online purchases</h3><p>If you make a purchase with us, whether as a MileagePlus member or as a âGuestâ, we collect information about you, including but not limited to traveler, payment information, contact and travel preferences.</p><h3>Offline purchases</h3><p>To make a purchase or transact other business with a United Customer Contact Center agent, a travel agent (including online travel agents outside of United), or a customer service representative (collectively, âReservations Agentsâ), Reservations Agents collect data such as payment information, passport information, birth date, name, addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. We may monitor and/or record telephone calls to Reservations Agents. By continuing with the call, you are deemed to consent to such monitoring and/or recording.</p><h3>United Club</h3><p>United may collect information such as name, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card information, in order to provide service to members of its United Club.</p><h3>COVID-19</h3><p>You may be required to provide information about your health, including (depending on your destination) lack or presence of symptoms related to COVID-19, COVID-19 test results, or COVID-19 vaccine information or information supporting your request for an exemption to a health-related travel requirement. We may offer you the ability to electronically provide such information to us, such as through our Travel-Ready Center or through a digital health pass. We may offer you the ability to request that United collect your information from a third party, such as a digital health app that you have chosen to use. We will use such information to help facilitate, but cannot guarantee, meeting your destinationâs requirements, to comply with applicable laws (for example, we may be required to confirm you have necessary travel documentation), and to help ensure health and safety during the travel experience. United is not liable for any assistance or information provided by any employee or agent of United to you relating to such documents or compliance with such laws, or for the consequences to you resulting from failure to obtain and present such documents, which shall be in good condition, or to comply with such laws. United also reserves the right to deny boarding to you if your information is not in good condition according to Unitedâs reasonable belief, or which otherwise do not comply with laws of the specific country you are departing from, transiting through, or travelling to. We may offer you the ability to provide contact information to help health authorities facilitate contact tracing. In some cases, your destination may require that you provide such information. We may be required by law to disclose contact information to health authorities or other government authorities.</p><h3>Biometric Information</h3><p>We may provide you the option to voluntarily participate in travel facilitation and security programs that use biometric information. These programs may include trial programs to expedite the boarding and baggage check processes, as well as security programs like the Traveler Verification Service administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. You should review any specific details regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of biometric information when considering whether to participate in these programs.</p><h3>In flight</h3><p>If a medical or other emergency occurs while travelling with United, we may collect information, including but not limited to first and last name, contact information, date of birth, medical information, and may share such information with third-party medical or other safety personnel as necessary or advisable. In non-medical or non-emergency situations, United may collect credit card and MileagePlus information in flight to enable present and/or future purchases.</p><h3>Children</h3><p>Due to the nature of our services, United will collect and maintain travel information, about children under the age of 13 when necessary to comply with federal aviation or security regulations, for safety or security reasons, or as otherwise necessary for United to provide transportation or other services requested.</p>    </div>

<p>Examples of the types of information we collect directly from you are described below.</p><h3>MileagePlus information</h3><p>When you enroll in MileagePlus, or if you are already a MileagePlus member, we collect specific information such as your name, address, phone number(s), email address, MileagePlus account number, and password or other account security authentication information. If you create a traveler profile, we also will collect the information that you choose to provide to us, which may include but not be limited to: payment information (e.g., credit card information, billing name/address), telephone numbers, email addresses, general requests or special needs, travel preferences and loyalty program information.</p><p>In certain situations, we collect information that is defined as âsensitiveâ under applicable data protection laws. We provide you the option to make a special meal request (on certain flights) and/or provide information about special travel needs. If you choose to make such request and/or provide such information, we collect information in order to provide accommodations during travel. In addition, MileagePlus members can choose to save their special meal requests and/or special needs in their profile information for use in connection with bookings made through united.com. These saved preferences and/or selections can be changed at any time.</p><p>Personal information collected and processed as part of our MileagePlus program is held by Mileage Plus Intellectual Property Assets, Ltd. (âMIPAâ), a member of the United group of companies, whose registered office is at Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland House, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. MIPA will be a data controller in respect of that personal information under the Data Protection Law, 2017 of the Cayman Islands (âDPLâ).</p><p>Where MIPA is the data controller, it processes MileagePlus personal information where it has an appropriate legal basis. This may be because:</p><ul><li>Our use of your personal information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organization (for example in order to make improvements to the MileagePlus program and services and to provide you with information you request);</li><li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (for example where we use your name and contact information to fulfill your MileagePlus benefits); and/or</li><li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to undertake vetting to comply with safety and security regulations or where we are required to disclose personal information to a court or tax authority).</li></ul><p>If you would like to find out more about the legal bases on which we process personal information, please contact us using the details below.</p><h3>COVID-19</h3><p>You may be required to provide information about your health, including (depending on your destination) lack or presence of symptoms related to COVID-19, COVID-19 test results, or COVID-19 vaccine information or information supporting your request for an exemption to a health-related travel requirement. We may offer you the ability to electronically provide such information to us, such as through our Travel-Ready Center or through a digital health pass. We may offer you the ability to request that United collect your information from a third party, such as a digital health app that you have chosen to use. We will use such information to help facilitate, but cannot guarantee, meeting your destinationâs requirements, to comply with applicable laws (for example, we may be required to confirm you have necessary travel documentation), and to help ensure health and safety during the travel experience. United is not liable for any assistance or information provided by any employee or agent of United to you relating to such documents or compliance with such laws, or for the consequences to you resulting from failure to obtain and present such documents, which shall be in good condition, or to comply with such laws. United also reserves the right to deny boarding to you if your information is not in good condition according to Unitedâs reasonable belief, or which otherwise do not comply with laws of the specific country you are departing from, transiting through, or travelling to. We may offer you the ability to provide contact information to help health authorities facilitate contact tracing. In some cases, your destination may require that you provide such information. We may be required by law to disclose contact information to health authorities or other government authorities.</p><h3>Biometric Information</h3><p>We may provide you the option to voluntarily participate in travel facilitation and security programs that use biometric information. These programs may include trial programs to expedite the boarding and baggage check processes, as well as security programs like the Traveler Verification Service administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. You should review any specific details regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of biometric information when considering whether to participate in these programs.</p><h3>Online purchases</h3><p>If you make a purchase with us, whether as a MileagePlus member or as a âGuestâ, we collect information about you, including but not limited to traveler, payment information, contact and travel preferences.</p><h3>Offline purchases: Telephone, travel agent or ticket counter</h3><p>To make a purchase or transact other business with a United Customer Contact Center agent, a travel agent (including online travel agents outside of United), or a customer service representative (collectively, âReservations Agentsâ), Reservations Agents collect data such as payment information, passport information, birth date, name, addresses, email addresses, and telephone numbers. We may monitor and/or record telephone calls to Reservations Agents. By continuing with the call, you are deemed to consent to such monitoring and/or recording.</p><h3>United Club</h3><p>United may collect information such as name, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card information, in order to provide service to members of its United Club.</p><h3>In flight</h3><p>If a medical or other emergency occurs while travelling with United, we may collect information, including but not limited to first and last name, contact information, date of birth, medical information, and may share such information with third-party medical or other safety personnel as necessary or advisable. In non-medical or non-emergency situations, United may collect credit card and MileagePlus information in flight to enable present and/or future purchases.</p><h3>Children</h3><p>Due to the nature of our services, United will collect and maintain travel information, about children under the age of 14 when necessary to comply with federal aviation or security regulations, for safety or security reasons, or as otherwise necessary for United to provide transportation or other services requested.</p>    </div>

        <h2><span>Protecting information collected</span></h2>

<div><p>United maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. When you place orders online to purchase services or access your MileagePlus account information, we use secure servers to protect your personal information, which is intended to encrypt the personal information that is transmitted between you and our sites. Although United takes reasonable steps to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, it cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and United makes no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your personal information.</p><p>If a third-party, including but not limited to a family member, friend, co-worker or corporate travel desk, seeks to transact business with United on your behalf, that party will be asked to provide us with the same personal information we would collect directly from you to complete your transaction. We consider that such third party has your consent and authorization to provide us with your personal information and make such transactions, including any subsequent changes, on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If such third party who has your full name and booking reference contacts us and seeks information on your booking or requests changes to it, we will disclose your booking information and allow such third party to make changes as we will conclude you have given them your consent to do so. Please note that the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by a third party is subject to your dealings with them and, if applicable, any of their privacy policies and practices. If you do not want an individual to obtain information on or make changes to your booking, you should not share your booking reference with them.</p></div>

        <h2><span>Your role in protecting your information</span></h2>

<p>To protect your privacy and United's proprietary databases and systems, you should not share any of your information, such as MileagePlus number or password, with any unauthorized individuals or third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to your sensitive account information. For more information, see our <a href="/web/en-us/content/help/PIN-password.aspx?POS=US">PIN/Password Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. You should also take all necessary steps to secure your mobile devices and protect information you may have stored on them. We do not have control over the security of your mobile device. United assumes no responsibility for the loss of information associated with security disrupting technologies, including but not limited to reverse engineering of mobile device applications or malware, that compromise the United mobile application(s) as a result of owner or third-party initiated changes to the mobile device. The security of that mobile device is the responsibility of its owner, not United.</p>

In addition, members can contact the MileagePlus Service Center by phone or in writing and request a profile change. Emails sent to members will contain a message and link on how to opt out of that type of communication in the future.
