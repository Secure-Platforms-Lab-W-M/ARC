                <p><strong>Applicants for Internal Employed Roles, carrying out operational activities connected to the performance of Robert Half</strong></p>

                <p>If you are applying for a role as an internal employee, working for us (e.g. carrying out work finding services for registered candidates and other work and activities connected to the performance of our Company as a sales consultant or in a corporate role) we will collect Personal Information from you via your CV, referees, professional and educational organisations and other sources. We will process your Personal Information for the purposes of administering the application, managing the internal hiring process and assessing your suitability. We will store your Personal Information securely in our confidential online HR database. Your Personal Information cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone except for members of HR and Talent Acquisition in the UK, Europe and the US and other staff if they are connected to the hiring process, such as interviewing, assessing your suitability for the role you have applied for and communicating with you. We do not share our HR database with any group companies, and we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected, secure and kept confidential. If we engage a third party to provide pre-employment screening services or testing, we will ensure that access is limited to the Personal Information that is compatible with those services and the service provider is contractually obliged to comply with applicable data privacy laws, confidentiality and provide adequate safeguards to keep your Personal Information secure until it is deleted or anonymised. By applying for employment with us, you consent to us processing your Personal Information for these purposes. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we will not be able to continue with your application. If your employment application is unsuccessful, we will retain your Personal Information on our HR database for a period of 6 months for the purposes of evidencing that we have conducted the recruitment process in a fair and transparent way and have not discriminated against applicants on prohibited grounds. At the end of the retention period, your Personal Information will be automatically deleted. Occasionally we may ask if you would like us to retain your CV data if we consider that you may be suitable for future roles. We will only do this with your consent.</p>

                <p><strong>Special Categories of Personal Information</strong></p>

                <p>Details about your unspent criminal or motoring convictions, court proceedings, or any pending proceedings relating to an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by you is processed only to the extent  it is relevant (for example to enable us to assess whether these present grounds for not taking your candidate registration or job application further) and may be disclosed to our clients so that they can determine if these are relevant to your suitability for a role within their organisation. If you provide health data we will process this only to the extent that it is necessary or relevant (e.g. for the purposes of making interview arrangements).   If you choose to provide us with other special categories of personal data (e.g. in your CV) and we do not need it, we will disregard this data.  Special categories of personal data will be processed in accordance with the restrictions imposed by law. This information will be retained for no longer than necessary before being deleted.</p>

                <p><strong>Our Clients and Suppliers</strong></p>

                <p>If you are a Client contact or supplier contact or a potential client or supplier, of goods and services we will collect and process information about individuals in your organisation. We may enter the individual’s name and business email address into our database as a designated corporate point of contact for that organisation, together with the individual’s other business contact data. The Personal Information we process about a corporate contact is the individual’s name for the purposes of contacting the organisation in relation to our services, authorising time sheets and for sending invoices or the supplier as a recipient of the supplier’s goods and services. If the individual corporate point of contact is also a registered candidate, we may be processing additional Personal Information for work finding and other purposes as described in this Notice. The source of a corporate point of contact may be the individual themselves, or their name and business details may be provided to us by a member of their HR or Procurement department or another hiring manager or existing business contact or a candidate we have placed at the organisation. We may also obtain these details from third party websites, social media and other public sources. We may send business to business email marketing to corporate points of contact. An individual corporate point of contact can ask us at any time to stop sending business marketing emails to their business email address by contacting:  dataprivacy@roberthalf.ie or clicking the ‘<strong>unsubscribe</strong>’ link in the email.</p>

                <h2>How we use your Personal Information</h2>

                <p>We use, process, store and disclose your Personal Information and other data we collect including during our Candidate Registration process, to provide you with work finding services including sending you job alerts by email, temporary assignments, project related work and permanent and fixed term contract placements in finance, accounting, technology, administrative, legal, marketing and other related roles, employment opportunities and career-related information. We will process your Personal Information in accordance with our candidate contract (provided during our candidate registration process) applicable to the type of work you are seeking, and we will disclose your Personal Information to our Clients in relation to their job vacancies. We will also process your Personal Information for other legitimate business purposes such as producing statistics, analysing how successful our marketing campaigns are, the number of visitors to RH websites and complying with other contractual, legal and regulatory obligations and duties. If you provide us with information about 3rd parties, we will assume that the 3rd party in question has given you permission to do so and to Robert Half collecting, processing and transferring their Personal Information to the same extent as yours.</p>

                <p>Currently we do not use automated decision making technologies to make final or conclusive decisions about you and a member of our staff will always be involved in the provision of working finding services.</p>

                <p><strong>Change of Purpose</strong></p>
                
                <p>We will only use your Personal Information for the purposes for which we collected it (e.g. the provision of work finding services if you are a registered candidate or to consider you for assignments working for our clients if you are an agency worker or consider you for internal employment working for us, if you are a job applicant), unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p>

                <p>If we need to use your Personal Information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

                <p>We may process your Personal Information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

                <h2>Transferring your Personal Information outside of Ireland</h2>

                <p>Robert Half is part of an international group of companies operating globally. We may share some of your Personal Information with our group companies, including <strong>Protiviti Limited</strong> a UK based consultancy, our parent company <strong>Robert Half International Inc.</strong>, based in the United States, and other group companies within or outside the UK and European Economic Area (EEA), who may use and process your Personal Information for similar purposes as described in this Notice. The data protection laws outside Ireland, the UK and Europe may not provide an equivalent level of protection to those in Ireland and in these circumstances, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected, secure, kept confidential and that we have a lawful basis for the transfer. This means we may require the 3rd party recipient to sign the EU Model Contract clauses approved by the European Commission as providing personal data with the same protection that your Personal Information has when it is processed within Ireland/UK/EEA.</p>

                <h2>Disclosing your Personal Information to members of the Robert Half Group of Companies</h2>

                <p>We share the Robert Half candidate database including your Personal Information with our group companies including <strong>Protiviti Limited</strong>, a UK based consultancy providing consultancy and work finding services across its business solution areas.</p>

                <p>From time to time we advertise Protiviti roles and if you apply, your CV and Personal Information is shared directly with Protiviti who will contact you about their role.</p>

                <p>If you register as a candidate with us, you may also be contacted by Protiviti in connection with job opportunities that Protiviti consider may be of interest to you such as Interim and Project Consultancy roles. You may be invited to register directly with Protiviti to enable Protiviti to represent you and provide its services. If you have already registered as a Robert Half candidate and you later decide to register with Protiviti, we may ask for your consent to share your Candidate Registration documents and your Personal Information with Protiviti, for your convenience.</p>

                <p>Protiviti has implemented the same high standards of data security as Robert Half and will treat your Personal Information in accordance with the law, respecting your legal rights and as set out in the Protiviti Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h2>Disclosing your Personal Information to 3rd Parties</h2>
                <p>To the extent necessary or appropriate and without notifying you, Robert Half may disclose your Personal Information to external 3rd parties (who are not members of the Robert Half group of companies) in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to companies and individuals we contract with to perform business functions and services on our behalf. Examples of service providers include: providing payroll services to enable us to pay our employees and agency workers who work on client premises; background screening and verification services; data storage facilities including in the US and the Cloud; hosting our Web servers; managing job posting applications via our 3rd party provider Broadbean; analysing data and producing statistics and legal, accounting, audit and other professional services.</li>
                    <li>to government agencies including Department of Justice, Revenue Commissioners, Collector General; Garda and other law enforcement agencies; regulatory and supervisory authorities (such as the Data Protection Commission); credit reference agencies; the Garda National Vetting Service; and 3rd parties performing sanctions and terrorism checks;</li>
                    <li>to comply with applicable laws, the service of legal process, or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law requiring such disclosure; (b) protect the rights or property of Robert Half or its group companies; (c) prevent a crime, protect national security or for fraud detection or prevention; or (d) protect the personal safety of individuals using RH websites or members of the public.</li>
                    <li>to 3rd parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, we will let you know; and</li>
                    <li>to IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our IT systems, service providers who we may appoint as data processors and to other service providers who may be based in the United States.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Where applicable, we will impose appropriate contractual, security, confidentiality and other obligations on to 3rd party service providers and processors we have appointed, based on the nature of the services they provide to us. We will only permit them to process your Personal Information in accordance with the law and our instructions. We do not allow them to use your Personal information for their own purposes and when our relationship ends, we will ensure your Personal Information is securely returned or destroyed or anonymised so that you can no longer be identified.</p>

                <p>Some of these 3rd parties are also controllers responsible for processing your Personal Information for their purposes, for example, Revenue Commissioners, Collector General is a controller for tax purposes. We may not be able to impose obligations or restrictions on these controllers in connection with how they process your Personal Information.</p>

                <h2>Keeping your Personal Information Secure</h2>

                <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to do so.</p>

                <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with Personal Information breaches and we will notify you and the applicable supervisory authority of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                <h2>How long we Retain your Personal Information</h2>

                <p>Robert Half will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes that we collected it for. This means we will keep your Personal Information throughout the period of your relationship with us and whilst we are providing you with work finding services.</p>

                <p>If you no longer wish to receive our services, you can request us to delete your Personal Information from our Candidate database. When we have deleted your data, we may retain your name and email address on our suppression list and subject to the services we have provided, continue to retain some of your Personal Information for our legitimate business purposes described below.</p>

                <p>We are required by law to keep basic information about our Candidates, Clients and customers (including contracts, evidence of identity, and right to work documentation, financial and transaction data) for up to 7 years from when our relationship ends, for legal, compliance, tax and audit purposes.</p>

                <p>Where there is no retention period stated in law, we determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information by considering the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of the data, the purposes for which we process it and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

                <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Information (so that it can no longer be associated with you and we cannot identify you). We do this for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this anonymised data indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                <p>You can request details of our retention periods by contacting us at: dataprivacy@roberthalf.ie.</p>

                <h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>

                <p>You have the right at anytime to:</p>

                <p><strong>Request Access</strong> to your Personal Information. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>

                <p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Information we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>

                <p><strong>Request erasure / deletion / removal</strong> of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where we do not have a valid reason to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing, where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Please Note: we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure for specific legal and compliance reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

                <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a 3rd party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

                <p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to process it.</p>

				<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your Personal Information to you or directly to another controller (data portability). This right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the Personal Information to perform a contract with you. We will (unless there is an exemption) assist you by securely transferring your Personal Information directly to another controller where technically feasible or by providing you with a copy in a structured commonly used machine readable format. The data we can provide is:</p>

                <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on your consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

                <p>We want to ensure we keep your Personal Information accurate and up to date. In addition to your legal rights, you may ask us to make changes or request a copy of your Personal Information informally, by contacting your local Robert Half branch.</p>

                <h2>Additional Information, Response Times and Fees</h2>

                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of your other rights or when you make an informal request). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person other than the individual who has the right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to help us locate your data and to speed up our response.</p>

                <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of these rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

                <h2>The Legal Basis for processing your Personal Information</h2>

                <p>We have set out a short description of main ways we will collect, store, process, share and disclose your Personal Information and the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.</p>

                <p>We will only use your Personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to fulfil a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;</li>
                    <li>where it is in our legitimate interests;</li>
                    <li>when it is our legal or regulatory duty; and</li>
                    <li>when you consent.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information in conducting and managing our business. We will consider and balance any potential impact on you and your legal rights when we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation or permitted to by law).</p>
