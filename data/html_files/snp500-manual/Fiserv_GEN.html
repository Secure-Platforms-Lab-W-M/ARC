    <h3>1. The personal data we collect</h3>
<p>We collect personal data about individuals from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why individuals must provide us with personal data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so.</p>
<p><b><i>Information that we collect directly from individuals and the parties with which we do business</i></b></p>
<p>We may collect personal data directly from individuals and the parties with which we do business, including prospects. These may include parties that interact with us directly (such as individuals who download our mobile applications or job applicants), parties to which we provide goods or services (such as clients, banks or financial institutions, merchants, and individuals) (collectively, “<b>clients</b>”), parties that provide services to us (such as vendors) (collectively, “<b>service providers</b>”), and other parties with whom we offer or provide products and services (such as independent sales organizations) (collectively, “<b>partners</b>”).</p>
<p>We may collect information from these parties in a variety of contexts, such as when completing one of our online forms, making an application for one of our products or services, interacting with us on social media, or corresponding with us. The types of information we obtain in these contexts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information of the business entity and its personnel who interact with us, such as name, job title, address, telephone number, and email address</li>
<li>Profile information, such as username and password that an individual may establish on one of our websites or mobile applications, along with any other information that an individual enters into their account profile</li>
<li>Demographic details, such as date of birth, country of citizenship and/or country of residence</li>
<li>Information about individuals’ affiliation with a legal entity, such as an individual’s role, and whether he or she is a beneficial owner or authorized signatory</li>
<li>Government-issued identification numbers (to the extent permitted under applicable law), such as a national identification number (e.g., a Social Security Number, tax identification number, or passport number), state or local identification number (e.g., a Driver’s License or other government-issued identification number), and a copy of your government-issued identification card</li>
<li>Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide when you request information from us, receive customer support, or otherwise correspond with us, including by interacting with our pages on social networking online sites or services</li>
<li>Financial account information, such as payment card or bank account details</li>
<li>Information about merchants, such as merchant name, merchant ID and category code, merchant location where a transaction occurred, and information about transactions processed by the merchant, including transaction volume, velocity, amounts, types of goods or services sold, and chargeback ratios</li>
<li>Information related to the use of Fiserv products or services, such as account information, spending thresholds, spending activity and patterns, and information about the transactions we process</li>
<li>Precise geolocation information, if you authorize our mobile application to access your location</li>
<li>Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications and details about how you engage with our marketing communications</li>
<li>Other information supplied by job applicants, such as professional credentials and skills, educational and work history, and other information of the type included on a resume or curriculum vitae</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Information that we collect about individuals who do not interact with us directly</i></b></p>
<p>We may receive personal data about individuals who do not interact with us directly. For example, our clients, service providers, and partners may provide us with information about individuals other than themselves when using our products or services. If you are providing us with personal data of another individual, please ensure you have brought this Privacy Notice to their attention. In addition, due to the unique nature of Fiserv’s business, in many cases, Fiserv obtains personal data from other participants in a transaction processing chain, such as card associations and debit network operators and their members. The types of information we receive about third parties includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Information about the personnel of our clients, service providers, or partners</b>, such as the business contact information that our clients, service providers, or partners provide to us in the context of our contractual relationships with them</li>
<li><b>Information about potential job candidates</b>, such as when a recruiter contacts us about an individual who may become a candidate for a job at Fiserv</li>
<li><b>Information about customers of our clients</b> that our clients send to us or allow us to collect in the context of the services that Fiserv performs, such as information related to financial transactions initiated by the customer, account registrations, and in some cases information needed to verify a customer’s identity and details of products or services purchased, and as otherwise stated in an applicable specific privacy notice for a Fiserv product or service. Where our technology is incorporated into a merchant’s mobile application or website, we also may automatically collect certain information of the type described in the section below titled “Information collected via automated means.”</li>
<li><b>Information obtained when processing </b>transactions, such as information about payment transactions</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Information we collect from private and publicly accessible sources</i></b></p>
<p>We and our service providers may collect information about individuals that is publicly available, including by searching publicly accessible government lists of restricted or sanctioned persons (such as the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List), public records databases (such as company registries and regulatory filings), and by searching media and the internet. We and or our third party verification providers may also collect information from private or commercially available sources, such as by requesting reports or information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
<p>We may also maintain pages for our company and our products and services on a variety of third-party platforms, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When you interact with our pages on those third-party platforms, the third-party’s privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant platform. If the third-party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your interactions with them (e.g. for lead generation purposes), we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><b><i>Information collected via automated means</i></b></p>
<p>When you access our websites or use our mobile applications, we, our service providers, and our partners may automatically collect information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity on our websites or mobile applications. Typically, this information includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on or in our websites or mobile applications, such as pages or screens you accessed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access. Certain products or services that we provide or which merchants may incorporate into their websites or mobile applications may automatically collect additional information, as may be further described in a separate privacy notice.</p>
<p>Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites. This information is collected via various mechanisms, such as via cookies, pixels, tags, web beacons, embedded scripts, through our mobile applications, and similar technologies. This type of information may also be collected when you read our HTML-enabled emails. Please refer to our <a href="/en/legal/cookie-statement.html"><i>Cookie Notice</i></a> for more details. You can choose to disable cookies or to opt out of the use of your browsing behaviour for purposes of targeted advertising. For opt out instructions, please review the “<i><u>Targeted online advertising</u></i>” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><b><i>Sensitive personal data</i></b></p>
<p>In limited circumstances and when permitted by law, we may request biometric data to confirm your identity, such as when we authenticate a payment using your fingerprint. In some circumstances, we may collect information that may reveal health or medical information, such as when we process transactions at health or medical facilities or pharmacies. In the context of processing employment applications, we may also request sensitive information, such as racial or ethnic origin or information about disability, where required or permitted by law of the country in which you are applying for employment.</p>
<p>Outside of these contexts or otherwise as we specifically request, we ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal data (meaning information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic, health, or biometric information, information about sex life or sexual orientation, or criminal convictions or offenses) through our websites or mobile applications, or otherwise to us.<a></a><br>

<p>Under certain circumstances, individuals in Europe, the UK and Brazil have rights under data protection laws in relation to their personal data. If you are located in Europe, UK or Brazil, you may ask us to take the following actions regarding personal data that we hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Access</b>. You are entitled to ask us if we are processing your personal data and, if so, for a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as obtain certain other information about our processing activities.</li>
<li><b>Correction</b>. If any personal data we hold about you is incomplete or inaccurate, you can require us to correct it, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
<li><b>Erasure</b>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. &nbsp;If you are in Brazil, you may also ask us to anonymize or block personal data that is excessive, unnecessary or where we may have processed your information unlawfully.</li>
<li><b>Object</b>. Where our reason for processing your personal data is legitimate interest you may object to processing as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li><b>Restriction</b>.<b> </b>You may ask us to suspend our use of your personal data in the following scenarios:<ul>
<li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
<li>where our use of your personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
<li>where you need us to hold your data for a longer period than we usually would, because you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Transfer / Portability</b>.<b> </b>Where it is possible, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to personal data provided by you which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li><b>Withdraw consent. </b>Where our reason for processing is based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
<li><b>Automated decision making</b>. You have the right not to be subject to automated decision making (e.g., profiling) that <i>significantly</i> affects you. The exercise of this right is not available to you in the following cases:<ul>
<li>The automated decision is required to enter into, or perform, a contract with you.</li>
<li>We have your explicit consent to make such a decision.</li>
<li>The automated decision is authorised by local law of an EU member state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in the first two cases set out above, you still have the right to obtain human intervention in respect of the decision, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</p>
<p>You can submit requests to exercise these rights by contacting the Fiserv Privacy Office using the following link <a href="http://www.fiserv.com/privacyrequests" target="_blank"><b><i>here</i></b></a>. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you are entitled to exercise a right in respect of your personal data, for example, a merchant identification number or account number. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>There may be legal or other reasons why we cannot, or are not obliged to, fulfil a request to exercise your rights. We will use available lawful exemptions to your individual rights to the extent appropriate. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights relating to your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We will respond to all legitimate requests promptly and, in any event, within any timeframes prescribed by applicable law. In general, we must respond to queries within one month from the receipt of the request, so it is important that requests are identified and submitted using the following link <a href="http://www.fiserv.com/privacyrequests" target="_blank"><b><i>here</i></b></a><b> </b>as soon as possible. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. Any transmission of your personal data will be handled in a secure manner.</p>
<p>If you are located in Europe, you also have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority (for more information go to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank"><i>https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</i></a>). If you are located in the UK, you also have a right to make a complaint to the ICO.</p>
<p><b><i>Cross-border data transfer</i></b></p>
<p>We transfer your personal data within the Fiserv group, including outside of Europe or the UK.&nbsp;Sometimes we transfer your personal data out of Europe within the Fiserv group to countries not deemed by the European Commission or ICO to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data, the transfer will be based on our Binding Corporate Rules, a copy of which can be found <a href="https://www.fiserv.com/BCR"><b><i>here</i></b></a>. FDR LLC is the group company responsible for compliance with our Binding Corporate Rules.</p>
<p>When we transfer personal data outside of Europe, within the group where the Binding Corporate Rules do not apply, or to third parties in countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data, the transfer will be made pursuant to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A contract approved by the European Commission (called “Standard Contractual Clauses”);</li>
<li>The recipient’s Binding Corporate Rules;</li>
<li>The consent of the individual to whom the personal data relates; or</li>
<li>Other mechanisms or legal grounds as may be permitted under applicable European law</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact us if you would like to receive further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of Europe.<a></a></p>

    <h3>9. Information for California Residents</h3>
<p>We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“<b>CCPA</b>”) to provide to California residents an explanation of how we collect, use and disclose their personal Information, and of the rights and choices we offer California residents regarding our handling of the personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Your California privacy rights</i></b></p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights listed in the section above titled Accessing, correcting or deleting your information. However, these rights are not absolute, and we may decline your request as permitted by the CCPA.</p>
<p>You are entitled to exercise these rights free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as by denying you goods or services, increasing the price/rate of goods or services, decreasing the service quality, or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights. However, the CCPA allows us to charge you a different price or provide a different service quality if that difference is reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information we are unable to use.</p>
<p><b><i>How to exercise your rights</i></b></p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you may exercise your access, correction, and deletion rights as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting <a href="http://www.fiserv.com/privacyrequests" target="_blank"><i>www.fiserv.com/privacyrequests</i></a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Calling 1-888-999-1114</li>
<li><b>Identify verification</b>. The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting the request before providing a substantive response to the request.<b> </b>A request must be provided with sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond. The requester must provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that the individual is the person about whom we collected information. A request may also be made on behalf of your child under 13.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Authorized agents</b>.&nbsp; California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf.&nbsp; We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Sale or Sharing of Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising</i></b></p>
<p>Our websites and online services may use analytics and advertising tools that enable us and our analytics and marketing partners to collect and disclose internet or other electronic network activity information based on your activity across our services and sites, including to analyze your usage of our services and to serve you advertisements that are relevant to you (collectively, “cross-context behavioral advertising”). However, please note that we do not knowingly sell or share the Personal Information of consumers under 16 without consent.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your Personal Information using our opt-out tool located in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.</p>
