   <p>The CCPA provides California consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. More specifically, you have the following rights regarding COMPANY's collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information:</p> 
   <p>
      <span>Right to Access/Know:</span></p> 
   <p>As a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information for the past 12 months. You may submit a verifiable request (<em>see "Submitting Requests" below</em>) that the following be disclosed to you: </p> 
   <ul> 
      <li>The categories and sources of Personal Information we collected about you;</li> 
      <li>Whether we sold or disclosed your Personal Information;</li> 
      <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or disclosing your Personal Information;</li> 
      <li>The categories of recipients of your Personal Information; or</li> 
      <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request), unless doing so would create an unreasonable security risk or is prohibited by law. </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
      <span>Right to Delete</span>:</p> 
   <p>As a California resident, you have the right to request that we delete all or some of the Personal Information we collected about you, subject to certain exceptions. You may submit a verifiable request (<em>see "Submitting Requests" below</em>) that may result in:</p> 
   <ul> 
      <li>The permanent and complete erasing of your Personal Information on our existing systems, with the exception of archived or back-up systems;</li> 
      <li>De-identifying your Personal Information so that it can no longer identify you; or</li> 
      <li>Aggregating your Personal Information with other information so that it can no longer identify you.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
      <span>Right to Opt-Out:</span></p> 
   <p>As a California resident, you have a right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information.</p> 
   <p> 
      <span>Right to Non-Discrimination:</span></p> 
   <p>As a California resident, you have a right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment as a result of exercising the rights conferred upon you by California law. In other words, the quality and price of the goods and services we offer will not be modified because you exercised your rights described above.</p> 
   <h3>Submitting Requests</h3> 
   <p>To exercise your access, data portability and deletion rights, as described above, please submit a verifiable request to us by:</p> 
   <ul> 
      <li>Calling us at 1-<span>800-752-8036</span>; or<br></li> 
      <li>Emailing us at 
         <a href="mailto:Privacy@CenterPointEnergy.com">Privacy@CenterPointEnergy.com</a></li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>Emailed requests must include the reference "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of the message and must include the email address or mailing address, as applicable, for us to send our response. We reserve the right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.</p> 
   <p>Only you, or an agent registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p> 
   <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Each verifiable consumer request must:</p> 
   <ul> 
      <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, or an authorized representative of such person; and</li> 
      <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>Upon receipt of your request, you will receive a confirmation that we received the request. We will then attempt to verify your identity and residency. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. You may be asked to sign a declaration that you are a resident of California. You will be informed of the timeframe for a response to the request and will receive communications if we are unable to verify identity, are complying with the request, or are denying the request.</p> 
   <p>If you have a password-protected account with us, you may verify your identity by re-authenticating your identity through existing authentication procedures. </p> 
   <p>For non-account holders, in order to verify your identity, you may be asked to provide information about your: home, office or service address, job title, service history, email address, account number or telephone number. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. We will need to verify your identity to a “reasonable degree of certainty” for requests to know categories of Personal Information, which may include matching at least two data points that you provide to those that we maintain about you. For requests to access specific pieces of Personal Information, or to delete highly sensitive information, we will need to verify your identity to a “reasonably high degree of certainty”, which may include matching at least three data points and requiring a signed declaration under penalty of perjury. </p> 
   <p>You may grant an authorized agent written permission to submit requests regarding your Personal Information. COMPANY may request proof of your written permission before responding to any requests made by a supposedly authorized agent. COMPANY may deny authorized agent requests if we are unable to verify your identity, or if you cannot provide proof that the agent is registered with the California Secretary of State and that you authorized the agent to act on your behalf. You may designate an agent who is registered with the California Secretary of State by following that agent’s specific authorization protocols.</p> 
   <p>If you choose to request that we delete certain portions of your Personal Information, it may affect your ability to use certain parts of the Services. If the request relates to information that COMPANY needs to make the Services function properly for you, you may no longer be able to use the Services.</p> 
   <p>COMPANY reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Information.<br role="presentation"></p>

   <h3>Changes to our Privacy Notice</h3> 
   <p>COMPANY reserves the right to make changes to this Notice at any time. Since this Notice may change over time as we modify or expand our Services, we suggest that you check back from time to time in order to understand how we treat your information. Our Notice’s effective date will always be set forth at the beginning and end of the Notice. Any changes will be immediately incorporated into this Notice, and will be prospective only. We will not make any changes that have retroactive effect unless legally required to do so.</p>
