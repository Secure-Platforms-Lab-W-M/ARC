<div><p>This <strong>Notice</strong> addresses how Carrier Global Corporation Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, <strong>Carrier</strong>) may collect and process personal information from you, as an individual, separate and apart from its <em>websites and mobile applications,</em> which may have their own privacy notices (please review the relevant site or mobile application for the applicable notice). Carrier Job applicants, please see our <strong><a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice-job-applicant/">Job Applicant Privacy Notice</a></strong>. For individuals in the United States, Carrier has a <strong><a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice-hipaa/">HIPAA Privacy Notice</a></strong>. See Carrier’s <strong><a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice/">Cookies Policy</a></strong> for information about cookies on our Websites and in our Apps.</p>
<p>Carrier interacts with individuals in a variety of ways: as end users of our products, employees of our business customers and suppliers, and others in our communities. To enable these interactions, Carrier may need to collect and process personal information. Carrier has implemented technical, administrative, and physical measures to safeguard any personal information we may collect. As this Notice is intended to cover a variety of situations, some information in this Notice may not apply to you. For example, if you do not have a warranty with a Carrier company, Carrier would not be collecting warranty information from you. Also, Carrier complies with applicable legal requirements and refrains from the collection or use of personal information in a location as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>Please review this Notice periodically for changes, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice. The effective date of this Notice appears below.</p>
<h2>What personal information might Carrier collect?</h2>
<p>Carrier collects personal information subject to applicable legal requirements. Because this Notice covers a wide variety of situations, there may be data elements listed here that do not apply to your specific situation.

<h2>With whom might Carrier share the information it collects?</h2>
<p>Carrier will not sell or otherwise share your personal information outside the Carrier group of companies, except to:</p>
<ul>
<li>service providers Carrier has retained to perform services on our behalf. Carrier will only share your personal information with service providers whom Carrier has contractually restricted from using or disclosing your personal information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements; comply with legal obligations, including but not limited to in response to a legitimate legal request from law enforcement authorities or other government regulators;</li>
<li>investigate suspected or actual illegal activity;</li>
<li>prevent physical harm or financial loss; or</li>
<li>support the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets, including through bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide services to a Carrier business and need to access a customer or end user’s facility, Carrier may need to provide your personal information to that customer or end user to facilitate your access to the site in compliance with security requirements.</p>
<p>Except where used in support of a contract with you or to fulfill a legal obligation, our use of your personal information will be only for legitimate business interests as set forth above.</p>
<h2>Where does Carrier store your personal information?</h2>
<p>Because Carrier is a global company with locations in many different countries, we may transfer your information from one legal entity to another or from one country to another in order to accomplish the purposes listed above. These countries include, at a minimum, the United States, the many of the member states of the European Union, Canada, and other countries, including some in Asia such as India. We will transfer your personal information consistent with applicable legal requirements and only to the extent necessary for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p>Carrier relies on available legal mechanisms to enable the legal transfer of personal information across borders. To the extent that Carrier relies on the standard contractual clauses (also called the model clauses) or Binding Corporate Rules to authorize transfer, Carrier will comply with those requirements, including where there may be a conflict between those requirements and this Notice.</p>
<h2>How long does Carrier retain Personal Information?</h2>
<p>Carrier retains personal information for the length of time required to fulfill the purpose for which it was originally collected and for any additional period as required by applicable law or regulation, court, administrative or arbitration proceedings, or audit requirements.</p>
<h2>What choices do you have about how Carrier uses your personal information?</h2>
<p>Where possible, Carrier will provide you with the opportunity to decide whether or not to provide your Personal Information. There may be circumstances in which you will not be provided with a choice, such as IT security practices like virus and malware scanning for individuals with access to Carrier networks. Depending on the nature of the personal information and the reason that Carrier may require it, Carrier may be unable to fulfill your request without collecting and processing your personal information.</p>
<p>You will always have a choice about whether Carrier uses your personal information for marketing purposes. If you have provided us with your personal information and would now like to request that it is no longer used for marketing purposes, please contact the businesses from which you are receiving the marketing communications. The communications themselves and the business website will provide you with the contact details.</p>
<h2>What additional information should specific individuals know?</h2>
<p><strong>California residents</strong> have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (<strong>CCPA</strong>), effective January 1, 2020, including the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>know what categories of your personal information we have collected and used, including how the personal information was collected;</li>
<li>know what categories of personal information are being sold or disclosed and if sold or disclosed, the categories of third parties receiving it;</li>
<li>access personal information collected about you; and</li>
<li>request that your personal information be deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Requests to exercise rights under the CCPA are subject to Carrier’s verification and certain restrictions under the CCPA. Carrier will not discriminate against California residents for exercising any of their applicable CCPA rights.</p>
<p>While California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information under the CCPA, Carrier does not sell personal information to third parties. If our practices change, we will update this Privacy Notice and take any necessary action to comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>California residents who wish to exercise their CCPA rights can contact Carrier at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy@carrier.com">privacy@carrier.com</a></strong>, or using the <strong><a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/ccpa-form/">webform</a></strong>; please put “California Privacy Rights” in the subject of your request and describe the nature of your request. You may also call Carrier regarding the CCPA at 1-833-617-0050.</p>
<p>As defined by California’s “Shine the Light Law,” California residents may annually request and obtain information that is shared with other businesses for their own direct marketing use within the prior calendar year. Carrier does not share your personal information with other businesses for their own direct marketing use.</p>
<p><strong>Users from the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries with privacy laws:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with your national or state data protection authority, which may also be known as a supervisory authority. You also have the right to withdraw consent, to request access to and correction or erasure of your personal information, seek restrictions on or object to the processing of certain personal information, and seek data portability under certain circumstances. Please contact Carrier with any request to access, correct, erase, object or seek restrictions or portability, using the contact methods below.</p>
<p><strong>Users from the United States:</strong> Carrier does not collect Social Security Numbers through <strong><a href="http://www.carrier.com/">www.carrier.com</a></strong>.
